## Outreach Templates

### Template A: Crypto-Native Founder/Investor

**Subject:** Quick question about Israeli crypto LP access

```
[First Name],

Saw your work at [Company] - impressive what you've built in [specific area].

Quick question: Have you ever wanted deal-by-deal access to global crypto/AI deals without committing $500K to a blind pool fund?

We're building NOTALONE - $10K minimum, 0% management fees, you vote on every deal. Already have 30+ countries represented in our LP base.

Given your background in [crypto/security/DeFi], thought you might find our Israeli pipeline interesting.

Worth a 15-min call this week?

[Your name]
```

**WhatsApp version (shorter):**
```
Hey [First Name], [Your name] here. Quick one - we're launching NOTALONE in Israel. $10K minimum LP platform, 0% mgmt fees, deal-by-deal voting. Thought it might fit your personal investing. Worth 10 mins?
```

---

### Template B: VC Partner (Personal Capital)

**Subject:** Personal crypto exposure without fund commitment

```
[First Name],

Fellow [Firm] portfolio companies/Israeli crypto founders keep asking me the same question: "Where can I put personal capital into crypto deals without $500K fund minimums?"

Built NOTALONE to solve this:
- $10K minimum (not $500K)
- 0% management fees (20% carry only)
- Deal-by-deal voting (you choose)
- Global deal flow (30+ countries)

Many VC partners join to get exposure outside their fund mandate. Thought it might interest you given [their fund's] thesis.

15 mins to show you current pipeline?

[Your name]
```

---

### Template C: Tech Exit Founder (Non-Crypto)

**Subject:** Crypto/AI allocation for post-exit capital

```
[First Name],

Congrats on [Exit/Company] - remarkable outcome.

Question for you: Are you allocating any personal capital to crypto/AI deals?

If so, we built NOTALONE specifically for people like you:
- $10K-$100K checks (not $2M fund commits)
- Deal-by-deal discretion (you approve every investment)
- 0% management fees
- Milestone-based founder funding (protects downside)

Many Israeli founders use us to get crypto exposure without becoming full-time crypto investors.

Worth 15 mins if you're curious?

[Your name]
```

### Template D: Connector/Introducer

**Subject:** Israeli LP intros - 5% referral on committed capital

```
[First Name],

Your name keeps coming up as someone who knows everyone in Israeli crypto.

We're launching NOTALONE in Israel - LP platform for crypto/AI deals ($10K min, 0% mgmt fees, deal-by-deal).

Looking for:
1. LPs who want crypto exposure without fund commitments
2. Israeli founders raising $100K-$1M

For you:
- 5% of profits on any LP you refer
- 2% of capital raised for founder referrals

Worth a call to see if there's fit?

[Your name]
```

### Template E: Follow-Up (No Response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] - one more thought

```
[First Name],

Following up on my note from last week.

One thing I didn't mention: we have [X] Israeli founders already in our pipeline, including [general sector - ZK/DeFi/AI]. Happy to share specifics if useful.

If now isn't the right time, totally understand. Just wanted to make sure this landed.

[Your name]
```

## Referral Multiplication System

After every call (whether they invest or not), ask:

```
"Before we wrap - who else in your network might be interested in this?
I'm specifically looking for:
1. Crypto founders who've had exits
2. VC partners who invest personal capital
3. Angels active in Israeli tech

Even 2-3 names would be super helpful."
```

**Target:** 3 referrals per call = 30 calls generates 90 new leads
