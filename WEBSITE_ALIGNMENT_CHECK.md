# Website Content Alignment Check

Comparing MASTER_NARRATIVE_CORRECTED.md vs. Published Website Content

---

## ❌ CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES

### 1. **Minimum Investment Amount**

**What I Wrote:**
- Self-Managed: $25K minimum
- NOTALONE-Managed: $100K minimum

**Website Says (notalone.xyz lines 67-70):**
> Start with as little as $10k, scale up to $100k

**ISSUE:** Website shows $10K minimum, not $25K
**Source Conflict:** concept.md line 94 says "Min check size: USD 25k"

---

### 2. **Performance Fee Structure**

**What I Wrote:**
- Carry: 10% (Funds) | 20% (Direct LPs)

**Website Says (notalone.xyz lines 60-63):**
> Performance-Driven Earnings: A flat 20% fee applies only to realized gains.

**ISSUE:** Website shows flat 20%, not variable 10-20%
**Resolution:** Website is clearer - it's a flat 20%

---

### 3. **Team Member Names (Spelling Errors)**

| What I Wrote | Website Says | Correct Spelling |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Clement **Chaikov** | Clement **Chalkov** | **Chalkov** ✓ |
| David **Shengart** | David **Shengert** | **Shengert** ✓ |
| Viktor **Yelizarov** | Viktor **Velizarov** | **Velizarov** ✓ |

**ISSUE:** I misspelled 3 team member names (from LP deck page 27)
**Source of Error:** LP deck may have had typos, or I misread

---

### 4. **Ankit Raj Experience Years**

**What I Wrote:**
> 4+ years in product and growth leadership

**Website Says (notalone.services line 80):**
> 10+ years in product and growth leadership

**ISSUE:** Website shows 10+ years, not 4+
**Source Conflict:** LP deck page 27 says "4+ years in product and growth leadership"

---

### 5. **Missing: NOTALONE Ecosystem Structure**

**What I Didn't Include:**

Website describes a multi-product ecosystem:

```
notalone.VC - Fund Operations, DD & Market Research, Liquid Deals
notalone.fun - An app, open investment network
notalone.eco - Ecosystem-as-a-Service, Full-Stack Regional Adoption
notalone.Services - Long-term war partner support
```

**ISSUE:** I didn't capture this product architecture
**Source:** This is only in website content, not in other docs

---

## ⚠️ TONE & MESSAGING DIFFERENCES

### Website Tone is More Aggressive

**My Version:** Professional, LP-focused, data-driven

**Website Version:** Edgy, founder-centric, aggressive

Examples from website:
- "Founders don't need sugar daddies. They need war partners."
- "Host events so lit, even the anons come out of hiding."
- "BUILD HARD. SCALE SMART."
- "Your War Path, Our Journey"
- "We're in the trenches"
- "Battle-tested global network"

**Analysis:** Website targets founders/builders with aggressive positioning, while my docs targeted LPs with professional tone.

## ✅ WHAT MATCHES

### Core Value Props Match

| Element | My Doc | Website | Match? |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Zero management fees | ✓ | ✓ (line 54) | ✅ |
| Deal-by-deal discretion | ✓ | ✓ (lines 77-81) | ✅ |
| Real-time dashboard | ✓ | ✓ (lines 89-93) | ✅ |
| Global network 20+ countries | ✓ | ✓ (line 12, 109) | ✅ |
| Full-stack growth services | ✓ | ✓ (lines 150-160) | ✅ |

---

### Team Bios Match (Except Name Spelling & Ankit's Years)

All team descriptions match website except:
- Name spellings (3 errors)
- Ankit's years (4+ vs 10+)

---

### Mission Statement Matches

**My Version:**
> Sovereignty First, Borderless by Default, Radical Transparency

**Website (notalone.services lines 112-113):**
> We believe venture building doesn't need to be a zero-sum game—it can be win-win for everyone: the investors, the entrepreneurs, and the enablers.

**Assessment:** Spirit matches, wording different

---

## 📊 MISSING FROM MY DOCS (That's on Website)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Primary Issue:** The website is MORE CURRENT than the LP deck and other docs I used as sources.

**Action Plan:**
1. Website should be considered the **source of truth** for public-facing info
2. Update all docs to match website specs ($10K min, flat 20%, correct names)
3. Resolve conflicts with team (Ankit's years: 4+ or 10+?)
4. Add missing ecosystem structure to narrative docs

**Create Updated Version?**
I can create a corrected version that aligns with website content if you'd like.
