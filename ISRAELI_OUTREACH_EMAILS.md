## Email Template 1: Israeli VC (Personal Connection - Warm)

**Use When:** You know the VC personally or have worked together before

**Subject Line:** Quick one - crypto/AI deal access without fund commitment

---

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: how much of your personal capital is sitting idle because you can't find good crypto/AI deals?

I know you're busy managing [Fund Name], but what if you could invest $10K-$50K of personal capital into pre-vetted deals WITHOUT committing to a blind pool?

I'm working with NOTALONE - built by the team that scaled NEAR/ICP globally (10K+ devs trained, 300+ projects launched).

**Here's why I thought of you:**

1. **Deal-by-deal discretion:** You see every deal, vote on which to back, zero forced allocations
2. **Zero management fees:** Keep 100% of capital working (only 20% carry on gains)
3. **Start with $10K:** No $2M fund commitment required
4. **Crypto/AI focus:** RWA, DeAI, BTCfi, AI infrastructure - sectors you know well

**Plus:**
- Milestone-based funding (founders unlock capital in 25% tranches)
- Real-time dashboard (full transparency)
- Withdraw unused capital anytime (no 3-4 year lockup)

Worth a 15-min call? I can show you:
- Current deal pipeline (20+ deals in crypto/AI)
- Platform demo (2 minutes to understand)
- How Israeli VCs are using it (some are referring portfolio companies, earning 2% on capital raised)

Or if you prefer, I'll just send a 5-min Loom and you watch on your own time.

Let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - You can also refer portfolio companies raising follow-on rounds. You earn 2% of capital raised, they get access to global LP base. Win-win.
```

## Email Template 2: Israeli Angel/LP (Professional Acquaintance - Medium Warm)

**Use When:** You've met at events, have mutual connections, but haven't worked together

**Subject Line:** [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out - crypto/AI deal access

---

```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Connection Name] mentioned you're looking for crypto/AI deal flow without committing to traditional VC funds.

I'm [Your Name] - we met briefly at [event/context]. I'm now working with NOTALONE, an investment platform specifically for angels/LPs who want deal-by-deal discretion.

**The problem we solve:**
- Traditional VCs: $500K-$2M commitment, 2% annual management fee, blind pool, 3-4 year lockup
- NOTALONE: $10K minimum, 0% management fee, you vote on every deal, withdraw anytime

**What you get:**
- Access to 1,000+ funds, accelerators, founders in pipeline
- Focus: RWA, DeAI, BTCfi, AI infrastructure, prediction markets
- Milestone-based funding (capital released in 25% tranches - protects downside)
- Full transparency (real-time dashboard, smart contract escrow)

**Why I'm reaching out:**
- [Mutual Connection] said you're active in [crypto/AI/DeFi]
- We have several Israeli founders in pipeline (Unit 8200, Weizmann alumni)
- You'd be perfect for our Israel cohort (building local community)

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I can show you:
1. Current deal pipeline (filter by sector/stage)
2. How voting works (community DD, milestone approval)
3. Referral program (earn 5% of profits on LPs you refer)

If you're too busy for a call, I'm happy to send a 5-min Loom instead.

Let me know what works.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're building an Israeli LP circle. Know any other angels/family offices interested? You earn 5% of their profits if you refer them.

## Email Template 3: Israeli Founder (Cold-ish - 1-Degree Away)

**Use When:** You don't know the founder directly but have a mutual connection

**Subject Line:** [Mutual Connection] intro - funding + growth support for Israeli founders

---

```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Connection] connected us - hope that's okay.

Quick context: I work with NOTALONE, an investment platform that combines funding + embedded growth support for crypto/AI founders.

**What we offer:**
- **Capital:** Global LP base (1,000 LPs target, 30+ countries)
- **Growth Support:** Marketing, tokenomics, GTM, partnerships, exchange listings
- **Fair Terms:** Milestone-based funding (25% tranches), no predatory VCs

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
1. [Mutual Connection] said you're building [project description]
2. Unit 8200 / [Weizmann/Technion] background = strong trust signal for global LPs
3. Your sector ([RWA/DeAI/BTCfi]) aligns with our thesis

**How it works:**
- You submit pitch deck + team background + milestones
- Our DD team reviews (1 week)
- Community votes (LPs decide if they want to back you)
- If approved: funding goes live + embedded growth team assigned

**Milestone-based releases:**
- 25% on approval
- 25% on tech/product milestone
- 25% on community/marketing milestone
- 25% on TGE/listing milestone

(If you fail a milestone, remaining funds return to LPs. Fair for everyone.)

**What you get beyond capital:**
- PR/KOL network (30+ countries)
- Exchange/market maker intros
- Partnership facilitation
- Technical audits (if needed)
- Community building support

**What I'm asking:**
Just 15 minutes to walk you through the platform and see if it's a fit.

If it makes sense, great. If not, no worries - I'll take your feedback to improve.

Sound fair?

Here's my Calendly: [link]
Or just reply with a time that works, and I'll send a Zoom.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - [Mutual Connection] mentioned you're raising [amount]. We typically do $100K-$1M checks, avg $500K. Does that fit your round size?

## Email Template 4: Israeli Ecosystem Leader (Direct, Founder-Style)

**Use When:** Reaching out to accelerator, university, or ecosystem program lead

**Subject Line:** Partnership opportunity - Israeli founder deal flow

---

```
[First Name],

You run [Accelerator/University Program/Ecosystem]. You see 100+ Israeli founders per year.

What if you could:
1. Give your best founders access to global LP base (1,000 LPs, 30+ countries)
2. Provide them embedded growth support (marketing, tokenomics, GTM)
3. Earn referral fees on every founder you introduce (2% of capital raised)

NOTALONE is an investment platform for crypto/AI founders. We combine capital + growth services.

**What your founders get:**
- Milestone-based funding ($100K-$1M typical)
- Embedded growth team (not just intros, actual execution)
- Fair terms (no predatory VCs)
- Global network (exchanges, market makers, KOLs across 30 countries)

**What you get:**
- 2% of capital raised for every founder you refer
- Example: 10 founders, avg $500K raise = $100K in referral fees
- Your program becomes more attractive (funding path + growth support)

**Our focus sectors:**
- RWA (Real-World Assets)
- DeAI (Decentralized AI)
- BTCfi (Bitcoin DeFi)
- AI infrastructure, prediction markets, payments

**Track record:**
- Team scaled NEAR (10,000+ devs trained, 300+ projects)
- Team scaled ICP (20,000+ devs, 350+ projects, 200+ hackathons)
- 30+ countries operational

**I'm not asking you to trust the platform yet. I'm asking you to refer 1 founder.**

Reply with:
1. One founder from your program (crypto/AI, raising capital)
2. Your take on what Israeli founders need most (so we can tailor support)

I'll work with that founder for free (no fees) to prove value. If it works, we formalize the partnership. If not, I'll leave you alone.

Deal?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're organizing an Israeli Founders x Global LPs event in Tel Aviv (Q2 2025). Want to co-host? Could be good exposure for [Program Name].

## Email Template 5: Follow-Up (No Response After 1 Week)

**Use When:** Sent initial email, got no response

**Subject Line:** Re: [Original subject line]

---

```
[First Name],

Following up on my email from last week (below).

I get it - you're busy. So let me make this even simpler:

**Tell me one crypto/AI deal you're looking at right now** (sector, stage, check size).

I'll show you if NOTALONE has similar deals in our pipeline. If yes, I'll intro you to the founder(s) - no platform, no commitment, just a warm intro.

If it's valuable → we talk about how NOTALONE works.
If it's not → I won't bother you again.

**Just reply with:**
- Sector (RWA? DeAI? AI infra? BTCfi?)
- Stage (Seed? Pre-TGE? Already launched?)
- Check size ($10K? $50K? $100K+?)

I'll respond within 24 hours with 1-2 relevant deals (or honest "we don't have anything" if we don't).

Fair?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

P.S. - If you're not interested at all, just reply "not interested" and I'll remove you from my list. No hard feelings.
```

## Email Template 7: Referral Request (After Successful First Investment)

**Use When:** LP/VC has invested in 1+ deals and you want them to refer others

**Subject Line:** Quick favor - who else should join NOTALONE?

---

```
[First Name],

Glad you backed [Company Name] through NOTALONE. Solid deal - [quick update on company progress if available].

**Quick favor:**

Who else in your network should I invite to NOTALONE?

I'm looking for:
- Israeli angels/VCs investing personal capital
- Family offices wanting crypto/AI exposure
- LPs frustrated with traditional VC fees/lockups

**Why this matters to you:**

You earn 5% of their realized profits when you refer them.

**Example:**
- You refer 5 investors
- They each commit $50K avg
- Deals exit at 3x (conservative)
- Total profits: $250K x 5 = $1.25M
- Your cut: 5% = $62.5K

**Plus:**
The more Israeli LPs on platform, the easier to form local co-investment circles.

Anyone come to mind? Just reply with:
- Names + intros (or I can reach out cold with your name as reference)
- OR just forward this email to your WhatsApp investor group

**Referral bonus reminder:**
- Refer LPs: 5% of their profits
- Refer deals: 2% of capital raised
- Refer projects: 2% of listing fee

Let me know who I should talk to.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If you don't have specific names, no worries. But if you think of anyone later, just shoot me a message.

## Key Principles for All Emails

### 1. Be Direct, Not Salesy
❌ "Revolutionary platform transforming Web3"
✅ "Investment platform with 0% management fees and deal-by-deal discretion"

### 2. Lead with Pain Point
❌ "We have amazing deal flow"
✅ "How much personal capital is sitting idle because you can't find good crypto/AI deals?"

### 3. Low Commitment Ask
❌ "Commit $100K to our fund"
✅ "Start with $10K, invest in 1 deal to test"

### 4. Proof Over Promises
❌ "We'll help you find great deals"
✅ "Team scaled NEAR (10,000+ devs trained, 300+ projects launched)"

### 5. Transparency on Fees
❌ Bury pricing at the end
✅ State upfront: "0% management fees, 20% carry on gains"

### 6. Respect Their Time
❌ "Let's schedule a 1-hour deep-dive"
✅ "15-min demo or 5-min Loom, your choice"

### 7. Israeli Tone (Direct, Action-Oriented)
❌ "We would be honored if you would consider..."
✅ "Worth a 15-min call? LMK."

### 8. Always Offer Value-First
❌ "Sign up to see deals"
✅ "Tell me your thesis, I'll intro you to 1 relevant founder (no platform required)"

**Day 20:** Give up OR try different angle (LinkedIn, mutual connection call)

---

**After Demo:** Email Template 6 (Next steps)
**Day 3 (if no response):** WhatsApp: "Hey, still interested in joining NOTALONE? Just need you to confirm Model A or B."

## Pro Tips for Israeli Market

### Use WhatsApp for Follow-Ups
- Email for detailed info, WhatsApp for "hey, did you see my email?"
- Israeli VCs/angels respond faster on WhatsApp
- Get WhatsApp number early (ask at end of demo call)

### Personalize Every Email
- Reference specific deals they're interested in
- Mention Unit 8200 / Weizmann / Technion if relevant
- Show you've researched their background (LinkedIn, portfolio, tweets)

### Follow Up Aggressively (But Not Annoyingly)
- Israelis are busy, don't take silence personally
- 2-3 follow-ups is normal (email → WhatsApp → final ping)
- After 3 attempts, move on

### Video Intros Work Well
- Record a 2-min Loom walking through platform
- Personalize it: "Hey [Name], here's how NOTALONE works, specifically for [their thesis]"
- Send Loom link in email (higher engagement than text-only)

### Test Subject Lines
- Israeli investors respond to directness
- "Quick one - crypto deal access" often better than "Introducing NOTALONE Platform"
- Avoid hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")

### Lead with Referral Value (For VCs)
- Many Israeli VCs won't invest personal capital (manage funds)
- But they WILL refer portfolio companies (earn 2% with zero work)
- Position referral program first, LP opportunity second

---

## Tools & Resources

### Email Tracking
- Use Streak or Mixmax to track opens/clicks
- If investor opens email 3 times but doesn't respond → send WhatsApp follow-up

### Scheduling
- Calendly link in every email (make it frictionless to book)
- Offer specific times if they don't use Calendly ("Tuesday 2pm or Thursday 10am?")

### Templates in Gmail
- Save these as Gmail templates (Canned Responses)
- Personalize [bracketed sections] for each recipient
- Never copy-paste blindly (always customize)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Map your Israeli network** (VCs, angels, LPs, founders, ecosystem leaders)
2. **Categorize by relationship** (warm, medium, cold)
3. **Pick appropriate email template** for each
4. **Personalize every email** (don't copy-paste blindly)
5. **Send 2-3 emails per day** (don't blast all at once)
6. **Track responses** (spreadsheet or CRM)
7. **Follow up after 1 week** if no response (email → WhatsApp → final ping)

---

**Remember:** Your personal credibility is the product in Phase 1. NOTALONE is just infrastructure. Lead with relationships, not technology.
