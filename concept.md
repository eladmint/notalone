Overview - Notalone is an investment and adoption collective. Its prime focus areas are blockchain, AI, and other emerging technologies


The problem - In emerging tech, the technology itself is less decentralized, but the investments and adoption of these technologies are still very centralized.
This leads to only a handful of individuals holding cards on the fate of the entire industry, leading to vested interest cabals deciding who succeeds and how. 

The entire model has become very extractive, with retail investors and projects providing exit liquidity for these cabals of so-called industry savors.

Three major groups are affected the most

Angels/LP:- 
Most of these people don't make much real money. Their portfolios look good on paper but not by the time these investments materialize. 70-90% of these investments fail to build a project. 5-9% are only able to launch their project, and only 1-2% can give a decent return. Net Net they hardly make any money on their investments. But the fund managers make money in any case from management fees and other services.
Most of these angles and LP/s, due to their small fund size, are not able to get access to liquid investments better venture deals (Pre-ico deals)
The deal flow is limited to a small network of people in the fund managers' network or event partnership by funds. Which deal gets to funding is also a very centralized process
The investors / LPs have very little say in which deals are invested
For VC deals - All the money is sent to projects directly and immediately, so in case of failures, there is a total loss
They have very less control on project success


Projects:-
They are at the mercy of fund managers and their cabal for deal terms
Post investment, your supply is very decentralized, where funds can decide the faith of your chart
They have to keep running to different vendors for different services from tech to investments to marketing to listing to community building
To succeed fast, they end up doing deals that kill their tokens and, eventually, the project
Good projects that have huge potential and don’t want to get played don’t have many options and have to give in for private sell eventually

Ecosystems
Ecosystems are dependent on fund managers to decide if they want to set up an ecosystem fund
Ecosystems have to provide their own money to set up an ecosystem fund with these VCs
The community of the ecosystem has hardly any say in the ecosystem fund
High-quality dealflow for ecosystems is limited due to team bandwidth and limited presence in various regions of the world
Existing ecosystem projects fail to scale due to lack of expert support and funding beyond grants

Service Providers
Gated Access / Picking 1,000 Locked Doors
Getting to the right decision maker is a real pain.
Navigating internal politics is impossible > You just pray and hope that your POC will come through.
You spend 6-12++ months to close the deal, with little to no feedback loop.
Projects Discovery Limits
You only know who you know. Expanding your network is time expensive.
You might have the best service, but you need to pitch it from 0 every time.
Keeping up and vetting the influx of new builders is very demanding.
Getting in on a new meta early is like marrying on a blind date. You commit based on someone’s recommendation, with limited data points. Driven by potential returns putting your reputation at risk.

Total service providers - 100+ 
Total ecosystems onboarded - 20+
Total projects funded - 200+
Have a RoI of 2x on the overall capital deployed

** Min check size: USD 25k
    Max check size: USD 5 million
    Avg check size: USD 100k


How much money will we make - 20- 25 million by 2028

From LPs - 21 million by 2028
Staking/liquidity provides the initial 10% commitment in stables: 10% of 100 Million = 10 million @ 4% APY, or 400k per year.
10 million we expect to be given to us directly by LPs who want us to manage the money; this will be another 400k per year
We expect overall 2x returns on 100 million, if we take 20% of that as profit of 20 million for us by 2028
For every deal brought in, the proposer gets 2% of the total invested amount. If we only get 25% of all deals to the investors directly, we will get 2% of 25 million i.e. 500k

From Service providers - 500k
We will be able to provide at least a service of 5% of our total investment via service providers i.e, 5 Million.
We will take 10% fees from these service providers i.e. 500k by 2028


From Ecosystems -  4 million
We will be able to give a service of 100k (in terms of adoption activities ) per ecosystem
So if we work with 20 ecosystems by 2028, we will get 2 million from them
We will be able to get at least 100k in grants from each ecosystem to the project which will be 2 million in grants. 
For this, we will get 2 million worth of tokens from projects
If we do 10X on 10% of this 2 million, we will get 2 million

How much we spend - 12.5 million

Team - 1 million /year - 4 million
Ecosystem services - 1.5 million
Tech - 500k
Compliances - 500k
OPs and Infrastructure - 1 million
Marketing - 4 million
Misc - 1 million  

Net profit - 8 million - 10 million, if we make overall 2X, this is very realistic 


If we raise 10 million in 2025:
7 mil under our management
Min of $100k
25% (first commit) = 1.75 mi > 4-5% APY > 100k
3 mil under self-management
Min of $25k
10% (deposit) = 300k > 4-5% APY > $15k profit


8 mil > Liquid Fund
50% profit > 4 mil > 20% profit > $800k profit
2 mil > Venture Fund
$20k in platform fees > 1% platform fee
$40k in referral fees (based on 50% of projects we bring) > 2% referral fees


Project
Grant
$100k Grant Application
$100k SAFT (100%)
$500k - grants raised
$500k SAFTS
$250k SAFTS Realize
Stake 10% > $25k Profit


Service Providers
5% of the revenue
1 project > using 10 service providers > 100k
10 projects > 1 mil > $50k profit

Any project going for TGE in less than 3 months
OTC deal with CMC/coingecko top 200 project as part of liquid fund
The aim should be to look for shorter vesting period and cliff

ICP Platform - Overview: It is a simple platform for collecting money from LPs, sharing deal flow, and distributing project tokens to the LPs.

Who are these LPs? They are retail who want to pay in stable coins or fiat

There will be 2 types of LPs here
Who just locks the 10% and then take part in each deal
Gives us the entire money at once or, in maximum two tranches, and let’s us decide on the deal on their behalf

Here are the different modules of the tech platform.


Deposit module:- 
This is a simple module where anyone can connect their wallet and make their deposit. 
They will need an option to choose from what type of LP they want to be from the above two options
Once they choose the option, they get to choose the total commitment that they want to invest over the next two years, and then, depending upon what type of deposit the money
Once they have deposited the money they will, they will get an NEFT, which has all the details of their terms and conditions of their investment engagement with the platform
We will also have different measures for them to move towards higher verification, which is verify your Social KYC connect Twitter account, then there will be verification of your email, then proof of personhood, and the ultimate step will be to get the proper KYC, but all of this is optional, you can have some for them to do it, but nothing stops them from investing
this will always be connected to their wallet if they lose access to the wallet at the signing. In only, we will give them option to connect an alternate wallet of the same protocol or standard ERC 20 or whatever if you are doing the bitcoin that it has to be a bitcoin wallet, but we can take two wallets as a backup wallet if they lose, and this has to be done during the making of the profile as long as they have access to their wallet.
With the money that is deposited through the deposit module, we get access to that money and they won’t have access to that anymore. We will have control over it. This basically goes into our multi, which is controlled by us and we will take this stables.

Deal flow module
This is about the deal flow, anyone can propose a deal while proposing the deal. They should be member of the platform.
You have to decide a percentage: 3 to 5% of the total raise for the deal will go to the proposer. We can even keep it less. This will help us to have more people getting the deals for us. We will also be the one who will be proposing the deal, so we will also get the percentage here as we are not charging any platform fee, so this can be something that the project should be okay with.
While proposing the deal, you have to attach the pitch deck. You have to. You have to attach various details of the investment like FDV, min check size, max check size, vesting schedule, and cliff. Also details of the milestone for the payment.
The wallet of the project has to be verified and so will be the details of the round and all
The DD team will get in touch with the project via the proposer to verify and negotiate the best deal for the platform.
The DD team will submit its submissions on the deal page of the project
Post which the commits will ask questions and then it will go for voting, Each member on the platform has one vote irretrievably of their overall commitment 
Post simple majority vote, the deal will be live for a stipulated amount of time for people to connect their wallet and fund
After each deal funding the investor gets an NFT which acts as the SHAFT for the investor and he/she can transfer it to anyone. Whosoever has the NFT they can claim the tokens of that project
The project gets another NFT as a proof of the investment they will receive as per their milestones

Claim module:- 
In this module, anybody who needs to claim tokens/funding from our platform can use it to claim it
Once they connect their wallet all the claims that is valid to be claimed can be redeemed 
In case there is a secondary sale of the SHAFT NFT the new wallet should have that NFT once the ownership is verified then the new wallet can claim the tokens
For investors while claiming the tokens the platform will check the avg price of token at the release date of token and then deduct 20% of the profit if there is a profit. In case of loss all the token ready to be claimed comes as it is
For projects they can claim the milestone payment once the milestone achievement claim has been approved by the DAO
In case project is not able to achieve the milestone the remaining money is returned to the investors

Governance module
Basic module to vote on milestone and listing of projects or changes to T&C or features of the platform
Same proposal module
Voting module 
Service module - any project/platform partner can submit a proposal for a service and empanelled service providers can bid for it. The proposer can choose the provider and the payment is facilitated via the claim page. The platform will take a % fee from the service provider /project to facilitate the deal. The project/service provider can leave their feedback at the end of the contract.
