Three Types of Deals We Care About
We work with projects in three ways:
Investment - our primary focus.
Support / Services - projects we can help as service providers.
Showcase / Pipeline - strong deals that do not fit our investment strategy but can be added to our pipeline for investor visibility and potential co-investors.
We only invest in and support token projects.
Equity-only projects go exclusively to the Showcase.
Information Hygiene
Every project must come with context. Always provide:
What is the deal? Investment, service, or OTC.
If investing or OTC:
How much are they raising/selling?
Valuation / FDV
Lockups, vesting schedule, TGE date
Team information - team must be known and non-anonymous.
All materials only via DocSend or Google Drive links.
Sending PDFs/files directly from 3rd parties is not acceptable.
Industry Priorities
We do NOT consider:
Gaming
Metaverse
NFT projects
We look very lightly at launchpads.
We actively like:
RWA
AI
DePIN
Innovative DeFi
Stablecoins and payments
Privacy
Trading infrastructure
Non-gaming consumer apps with traction
Etc. native web3 industries
We are open to all other non-excluded sectors.
Investment Filters
Valuation
Preferred FDV: up to 50M
Exceptional cases: 50–100M (rare)
TGE Timing
Preferred: H1 2026
H2 2026 only in special cases
We must be fully unlocked within 18 months post-TGE
Significant unlock in the first 6 months (Day-1 unlock, or vesting without cliff, etc.)
OTC Deals
Minimum 30% discount, preferably 50%+
Full unlock in 6–9 months
Traction & Investors
Real traction preferred (not partnerships, not social metrics)
Traction is important but lack of traction is not an automatic rejection
Tier-1 / Tier-2 investors are a bonus, not a requirement
Project Profile example
A strong example of what we want:
Startup operating 12+ months
Live product with early traction and signs of PMF (product-market fit)
Not gaming; ideally Native Web3 in a hot sector
Known, validated team
Token launch planned within ~6 months
Token lockups example: 3-month cliff, 10% TGE unlock, 12-month vesting
Current valuation 25–40M
Previous round at ~15M valuation with Tier-2 funds
Still has runway; can reach TGE even without new funding
Community growth driven by product, not airdrops


Investment Framework Policy
This document outlines the framework for evaluating and managing investments in token launches. Adherence to this policy is essential, as analysis shows that pure, unhedged investment strategies are financially unjustified.

Core Thesis & Guiding Principles
The foundational analysis reveals a challenging investment landscape where positive returns are the exception, not the rule.
Negative Baseline: Median outcomes for token launches are consistently negative, with returns worse than -50% across all market conditions (bull, bear, accumulation) at 6 to 18-month horizons.
Low Success Rate: Only 20-30% of token launches deliver positive returns over 180, 365, and 545-day periods.
Three Pillars of Viability: 
A successful investment strategy cannot rely solely on "picking good companies". Viability is built upon the disciplined application of three pillars:
    1. Market Timing: Launching the token in the correct market regime.
    2. Valuation Discipline: Securing a sufficiently deep discount at entry.
    3. Systematic Hedging: Actively managing risk post-launch while assets are locked.

Market timing framework
The objective is to time the investment so that the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurs in the most favorable market regime for the given lockup period.
Five market regimes have been identified, each with distinct performance characteristics. No single regime offers positive median returns, making discount acquisition critical
Accumulation Below - bottoming phase below prior ranges; choppy, value-seeking, improving risk appetite from depressed levels. Median window ~300 days. Often precedes Just Growth.
Best for long lockups (12-18 months). While medians are around -50%, this regime offers the best "survivability," with the probability of a positive return (%Green) rising to over 31% by 545 days.
Just Growth - steady up-drift without euphoria; breadth improves but not a melt-up. Median ~134 days. Often leads to Bear (60%) or Accumulation Above (40%).
Generally unattractive and should be avoided. These regimes have severe median decay and should only be considered if exceptionally large discounts (≥70-80%) are available.
Accumulation Above - early breakout and consolidation above prior ranges; strength building before a bull run. Median ~75 days. Often transitions to Bull Run (~67%).
Best for short lockups. Offers the least negative short-term median returns (P50 of -35% at 180d) and the highest potential for outsized "moonshot" returns.
Bull Run - persistent, broad upside and momentum; euphoria pockets; median ~126 days; historically followed by Bear.
Strong short-term average returns (3-4x) but with rapidly collapsing medians (-70% at 12M). Only viable with very quick unlocks or strict hedging.
Bear Market - persistent downtrend, lower lows, risk aversion; median ~221 days; often transitions to Just Growth (60%) or back to Accumulation Below (40%).
Generally unattractive and should be avoided. These regimes have severe median decay and should only be considered if exceptionally large discounts (≥70-80%) are available.
Observed regime transitions (most frequent):
Just Growth → Bear 60% | Acc Above 40%
Acc Above → Bull Run 67% | Just Growth 33%
Bull Run → Bear 100%
Bear → Just Growth 60% | Acc Below 40%
Acc Below → Just Growth 100%.

Timing strategy
Use historical regime durations and transition probabilities to plan investments 6-18 months before a planned TGE.
To Target Accumulation Above (for short lockups): Invest during the "Just Growth" phase, as it frequently transitions to "Accumulation Above".
To Target Bull Run (for fast liquidity): Invest during "Accumulation Above," which has a high probability of transitioning into a "Bull Run".
To Target Accumulation Below (for long lockups): Invest during a "Bear Market," as it often transitions to "Accumulation Below".
Lockup guidance if we invest in a given regime
Invest in Bear - prefer long lockups (12–18 months) so TGE lands in Accumulation Below; avoid listing during late Bear.
Invest in Accumulation Below - prefer long lockups (12–18 months). Listing in the same phase or just after the turn retains the softer year-out medians.
Invest in Just Growth - prefer short lockups (≤180–270 days) to aim the TGE for Accumulation Above and harvest better short-run stats.
Invest in Accumulation Above - only with short lockups (≤180 days) or strong hedge; phase is short and often runs into Bull then Bear.
Invest in Bull Run - only with very short lockups (≤90–180 days) and strict hedge, otherwise medians collapse beyond ~12 months.

Valuation Framework
Rule of thumb:
Required Entry→TGE Multiple ≈ 1 / (1 + P50 at the horizon we care about).
Example (rounded):
Acc Above, 180d: P50 ≈ −35% → need ~1.54× uplift from our entry valuation to TGE FDV.
Bear, 365d: P50 ≈ −75% → need ~3.97×.
Bull Run, 545d: P50 ≈ −80% → need ~5.08×.
FDV guardrails at entry (deal stage):
Pre-seed: $10–15M.
Seed: $25–40M (ideally ≤$30M).
Exceptions up to $70–100M only with outstanding DD and hedge access.
Horizon takeaway
The longer the lockups we accept, the lower our entry FDV must be or the higher our credible TGE FDV must be.
Why: medians deteriorate from 180 → 365 → 545 days across bins and regimes, so the required Entry→TGE multiple climbs (e.g., Bin5 needs ~5.0× at 365d and ~6.9× at 545d). If the path to that TGE uplift is not credible, we pass.

Sectors
No robust, persistent sector edge in the data; differences are small and outliers dominate. Sector and within-sector decisions must be made based on sector-specific analysis. Plan for October - conduct these sector-specific analyses on high-priority sectors. 

Hedging requirement
Hedging is an essential, mandatory component of the investment process to manage post-TGE drawdowns and provide partial liquidity while primary assets are locked.
Precondition to invest – A deal is not viable unless the token is confirmed to list on a centralized exchange with liquid perpetual futures. Without this, position control is impossible, and the investment should be passed on.
Expected effect: 
Our backtests show that leveraging this hedging strategy in 90%+ cases allows to maintain the position NAV at the TGE level or higher and almost never below. 
Anchor and trigger
VWAP from TGE = the average price since listing, weighted by traded volume.
If the daily close is below VWAP - market is weak → we put the hedge on (full notional).
If the daily close is above VWAP - market is strong → we keep the hedge off.
Risk controls
If the hedge moves ~10% in our favor, move stop to breakeven.
Scale profits at roughly −20% / −40% / −60% from short entry.
Exit hedge if price closes back above VWAP or hits the upper VWAP band (sharp reversal).
Funding cap - we do not carry a short that costs more than ~20–30% annualized.
Human overlay
The rules are a baseline. Judgment is key to skip signals in long ranges, re-open hedges on failed retests of VWAP, and factor in broader market news and liquidity. The goal is to lower the investment's cost basis while the combined long/short position remains net positive.

IC rules
Confirm a clear path to a centralized exchange listing with liquid perpetual futures.
Identify the target TGE market regime based on the investment timeline.
What regime are we in right now, how long is it going
What regime is expected next, when and for how long
When is the expected launch regime according to that
Ensure that lockups are in line with the target regime
Take into consideration the team’s promised launch FDV and realistic expectations
Verify that the entry valuation falls within the acceptable pre-seed/seed thresholds
Pre-seed $10–15M, Seed $25–40M (≤$30M preferred); exceptions $70–100M only with outstanding DD
Important Notice: 
This guidance is based on quantitative data analysis of past token launches and relies solely on historical market statistics and dynamics. It may evolve in the future, and it is not intended to serve as a standalone investment manual. 
Naturally, projects are selected through full due diligence, which covers product, market, progress, team quality and delivery ability, technology, and positioning among clients, competitors, and providers. 
This framework does not replace due diligence – it complements it by addressing risks that classical due diligence cannot capture. 
Its purpose is to set boundaries and tactics for managing those market and timing risks, while traditional due diligence remains the foundation for evaluating project fundamentals.




Notes on Venture Deal in Crypto

We don't invest in anything above 20M FDV, a rare case exception. The launch FDV should be 50% more at least from the investment FDV 
Lower is an example, why it must be not 50%, but 200-400% higher. OR nearly instant unlocks.
10% bare minimum unlock at TGE, ideal 20%
Max lockup of 2 months for investment done till Feb 2026
Linear weekly or bi-weekly unlocks for max 2 months, rare cases 3
The problem with that is that good terms for us = unhealthy tokenomics in general. So we need to keep the balance for long-term sustainability of the projects we invest in and the Fund and the Platform.
Net Net out of an investment in 4-6 months.
Opt for a lock-up period from the day of investment
Put refund rules or more unlocks with interest if delay in TGE beyond 30 days.


Rule of thumb:
Required Entry→TGE Multiple ≈ 1 / (1 + P50 at the horizon we care about).
Example (rounded):
Acc Above, 180d: P50 ≈ −35% → need ~1.54× uplift from our entry valuation to TGE FDV.
Bear, 365d: P50 ≈ −75% → need ~3.97×.
Bull Run, 545d: P50 ≈ −80% → need ~5.08×.
EXAMPLE: 
We invest during the Accumulation Above. 
We expect listing during the Bull run. 
We are fully unlocked in 1.5 years. 
We know that the majority of projects are -80% from TGE in 1.5 years. 
Our proposed FDV is $20M. 
Means that ideally in 1.5 years, when we will be -80%, we still want to be at 20M FDV or higher. 
Means that 20M FDV is 20% (100%-80%). Means that 100% must be 20*5 = 100M FDV - THIS IS TGE FDV THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE (or higher). 
Means that our analysis must consider how realistic is it to achieve such TGE FDV. If yes - in what means and how can we influence that. Is it in line with teams’ plans? 
If not - negotiate lower FDV, and any preferential terms. 

The purpose of this analysis was to understand how OTC deals actually perform, whether they provide a tangible edge over TGEs or secondary market entries, and to derive realistic statistical benchmarks for both investor communication and internal strategy.
Key takeaways
OTC deals smooth downside risk thanks to entry discounts, while still preserving room for asymmetric upside.
On Q1 2025 dataset, a pure buy & hold lost -14% in six months. Adding a systematic VWAP hedge flipped the result into a +12-13% gain.
OTC works best as a portfolio strategy: individual trades are noisy (8 winners, 25 losers), but diversification across 15–20+ deals per quarter stabilizes returns.
The true cornerstone is still fundamental due diligence. Statistical farming matters – but choosing projects with strong positioning, momentum, and financial logic remains critical.

How we got there
We reviewed 33 OTC deals from Q1 2025 on OFFX (reliable source of high-liquidity and high-quality OTC deals). Each deal was assigned a notional $100,000 investment, for a total portfolio of $3.3M. The horizon chosen was six months, reflecting a realistic expectation for liquidity (3-12 months, but six is the most common benchmark).
On day 0, the aggregate discount meant that $3.3M cash translated into ~$5.7M worth of tokens (an assets-to-cash multiple of 1.73×). However, six months later the buy & hold portfolio stood at $2.83M (-14%).
The distribution showed the volatility clearly: only 8 out of 33 trades were profitable, while 25 were not. This reinforced the point that OTC is not suitable for one-off bets – statistical smoothing only emerges with scale.
We then tested hedging strategies using perpetual futures, since all tokens were listed on major exchanges. Out of ~10 approaches, the most effective was anchored VWAP: 
open shorts when daily close < VWAP, close when above. On the same portfolio, this hedge delivered +8-11% profit instead of -14% loss. In other words, the hedge not only neutralized the drawdown but produced a gain.
IMPORTANT: 
Maintaining such hedges requires additional capital for margin (20–30% of the portfolio, effectively 3–5× leverage). But even accounting for this, the economics work: the $3.3M portfolio moves into profit territory, while upside remains open if the market turns. Positive funding rates on most of these tokens also add carry to short positions, further improving returns.

Final perspective
Statistically, OTC deals provide a smoother risk profile and retain upside potential. Yet across our sample we did not find reliable patterns in project stage, market phase, industry, or valuation that determined performance.
This leads to a dual conclusion:
Yes, OTC offers an edge – lower entry prices, risk smoothing, and the ability to hedge systematically.
But the most effective way to exploit this edge is statistical farming (a broad portfolio of deals) combined with rigorous qualitative and financial due diligence.
In practice, this means deploying capital across many OTC deals each quarter, applying simple systematic hedges, while picking projects with strong positioning and momentum (using the DD approach used in cases like KAVA or Open Campus).

Pipeline -> Screening -> Intro Call -> DD -> IC -> Portfolio
Pipeline size benchmark: 800-1000/year
Investable: 5-15%. 
Screening should drop 50-70% of obviously bad projects.Answer to: 
Are there reasons to spend more than 5-10 minutes of my time?\
Are there reasons to NOT?  

Method & Purpose
This is a rapid analysis of a project against key filters to decide whether to proceed to a call or reject.
Objective: to skip obviously bad projects early (no time waste) AND not skip good projects at all. 
Use only available materials: blurb, website/landing page, pitch deck, open data.

Screening Steps
1. Identify the Core → Common Sense Check
Purpose: Understand what the project is, who it is for, and whether it makes sense at all. This step feeds directly into the common-sense filter – if there is no clear value, market, or uniqueness, the process can stop here.
Questions to answer:
What does the project do?
Who is the target audience?
How is value created for them?
What is the key uniqueness?
If answers are unclear, overly generic, or match dozens of existing products – treat them as a red flag.

2. Common Sense
Purpose: Validate whether the problem is real and worth solving, and whether the solution is credible.
Questions to answer:
Is there a real, data-backed problem (“pain”)?
Is there a defined market?
And is it growing? 
Is the market already saturated with similar solutions?
Is it hard to copy?



3. Current Status
Purpose: Gauge the team’s ability to execute and deliver over time.
Questions to answer:
Time since inception – Have they achieved meaningful progress in that time?
Deliverables to date – Is there an MVP, beta, or other tangible product?
Product in active use? – Are there actual users engaging with it?
Growth & engagement metrics – Is there momentum, or is it stagnant?
Scalability proof? - can that serve 10000x more users without a respective increase in headcount/resources? 
Lack of visible progress over 12+ months is a major warning sign. (even 3 months) 

4. Team
Purpose: Determine whether the team has the expertise and network to succeed in the target market.
Questions to answer:
No to anons
Relevant industry experience?
Previous founder or advisor experience?
Track record of exits or notable achievements?
Relevant advisors supporting them?

5. Social Proof
Purpose: Assess third-party validation and ecosystem integration.
Questions to answer:
Who are the investors (funds, angels)?
Partnerships with established players?
Positive coverage in reputable media?

6. Valuation & Tokenomics
Purpose: Ensure entry terms are reasonable and liquidity risk is managed.
Questions to answer:
FDV within acceptable limits
<50M
Below 5M is suspicious 
Token unlocks spread over ≥ 24 months (18)
TGE plan (within next 6-9 months) 

Kill Criteria (Immediate Reject)
Unclear or vague product description.
No identifiable problem or need.
No relevant team experience.
More than 6 months without product or traction.
Direct clone without differentiation.
Sector out of focus.
Unrealistic or unjustified projections.
