&milio | AI-Powered DeFi Automation Platform | Raising $2.5M-$4M @ $9M pre / $15M cap | Deck | App

&milio is building an AI-native DeFi automation platform that eliminates the complexity crisis facing crypto traders. Think "Autopilot for DeFi" - users set goals, AI agents execute across 100+ protocols, 15+ chains, and 100M+ trading pairs automatically.

# TRACTION (Nov 25 snapshot):

User Growth:
- 2,480 WAU (beta users)
- 562 DAU
- 52,700 total orders (alpha-to-date)
- 314 Active Auto Traders (≥$1 SOL) in month one

Engagement & Retention:
- 30% of active users activate Auto Trader feature
- 50% of Auto Trader users (min $150 deposit) have already topped up
- 81% retention for Auto Trader users
- ~50% daily retention overall

Revenue & Volume:
- $10K total fees generated
- $3.5K MRR (run rate)
- $1.3M cumulative volume
- $95K weekly volume (ATH)
- 4,787 weekly orders (+24% WoW growth)
- $120K AUM (user funds on protocol)

# WHY IT WINS

Position:
Massive complexity crisis in DeFi - 420M crypto users globally, 50M active traders struggling with 100+ protocols across 15+ blockchains. User pain validated: 84% report missing opportunities, 76% struggle with portfolio management, 92% want simplified DeFi access, 68% fear making mistakes.

Category timing is perfect: DeFi AI emerging as new $11.1B market cap category with 10K+ smart engagement. Record-breaking revenue in Trading Bots, Launchpads, Prediction Markets, and Perpetual Systems creating tailwinds.

Economics:
Strong monetization already proven - $10K fees generated in beta, tracking to $3.5K MRR. Multiple revenue streams via trading fees, protocol fees, and premium features.

Token economics designed for value accrual:
- Buy & Burn: % of protocol revenue used to buy & burn tokens (deflationary)
- Stake to Participate: Required staking for advanced Auto Trader features, advanced compute, models, and strategies
- Performance Incentives: Rewards for strategy sharing, agent performance bounties, community contributions

Market opportunity: $84T annual global crypto trading volume, $100B+ DeFi TVL, 420M crypto users with 50M active traders.

Product:
AI agents navigate the entire DeFi landscape autonomously - users don't need to understand protocols, gas optimization, or timing. The product is live and working, not vaporware.

Proven retention metrics (81% for Auto Traders, 50% daily) and activation funnel (30% upgrade to Auto Trader, 50% top-up) demonstrate strong product-market fit.

- AutoTrader system with asset allocation and strategy matching engine
