## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Launch NOTALONE in Israel through a Tel Aviv roadshow, securing LP commitments and Pre-TGE deal flow from the Israeli crypto/AI ecosystem.

| **Fundraising** | LP Deck localized (Hebrew) | 1 |
| **Fundraising** | Pre-TGE projects identified | **5** |
| **Fundraising** | PR/media announcements | 3 |
| **Fundraising** | Public mentions by investors | 3 |

**Core Strategy:** Use Israel Roadshow as anchor event to:
1. Secure **3 LP commitments** (VCs/Angels investing personal capital)
2. Identify **5 Pre-TGE Israeli projects** for NOTALONE funding
3. Build brand awareness in Israeli Web3/AI ecosystem
4. Establish media/KOL partnerships for ongoing presence

**Unfair Advantage:** Your deep Israeli network + NOTALONE's no-commitment LP model (VCs can join with $10K, not $500K fund commitment)

---

## Market Context: Israeli Web3 Ecosystem

### Key Insight from Collider Ecosystem Report

**Israeli VCs Invest OUT, Not IN:**
- Israeli VCs raise capital from international LPs
- They deploy internationally, not domestically
- Hard to fundraise FROM Israeli investors (they're capital exporters)

**Implication for NOTALONE:**
- Don't pitch "Israeli fund investing in Israeli startups"
- DO pitch "Join global LP network with $10K, access crypto/AI deals worldwide"
- Position Israel as **deal flow source** (founders), not **capital source** (LPs)

---

### Israeli Crypto/AI Strengths

**Technical Talent:**
- Unit 8200 (elite military cyber unit)
- Weizmann Institute, Technion (academic research)
- Matzov, 8200 EISP (entrepreneurship programs)

**Sector Expertise:**
- Cybersecurity (StarkWare, Fireblocks)
- ZK/cryptography (Starknet, Polygon zkEVM contributors)
- DeFi infrastructure (Bancor, Orbs)
- AI infrastructure (emerging)

**Exit Track Record:**
- PayPal acquired Curv
- Coinbase acquired Unbound Security
- Chainalysis, Fireblocks, Wiz (Israeli-founded unicorns)

---

### Why NOTALONE Has Unique Opening

**Thesis:** Israeli VCs want deal-by-deal crypto/AI exposure WITHOUT committing $500K-$2M to a fund.

**NOTALONE's Model:**
- ✅ Join as LP with **$10K minimum** (not $2M)
- ✅ Vote on every deal (no blind pool)
- ✅ 0% management fees (only 20% carry on gains)
- ✅ Access global deal flow (not just Israeli)
- ✅ Withdraw anytime (no 3-4 year lockup)

**Plus for Israeli Founders:**
- ✅ Apply for funding ($100K-$1M)
- ✅ Get embedded growth support (marketing, tokenomics, GTM)
- ✅ Milestone-based releases (25% tranches)
- ✅ Access to global LP network (1,000 LPs target, 30+ countries)

---

## Target Audience Segmentation

### Primary: Israeli VCs & Angels (As LPs)

**Profile:**
- Small crypto/AI funds ($5M-$30M AUM)
- Solo GPs, angel syndicates
- Family offices with crypto allocation
- Active investors wanting personal deal exposure

**Pain Points:**
- Want crypto/AI exposure without committing $500K to blind pool
- See 100+ decks/month, only 2-3 relevant
- Miss top deals (move too fast)
- Traditional VCs have 2% annual mgmt fees

**NOTALONE Value Prop:**
> "Join as LP with $10K. See every crypto/AI deal before voting. 0% management fees. Invest only in deals YOU choose. Withdraw unused capital anytime."

**Target:** 30 investors mapped, 20 meetings, 3 soft commitments

---

### Secondary: Israeli Founders (Deal Flow)

**Profile:**
- Pre-TGE crypto/AI projects
- Strong technical team (Unit 8200, Weizmann, Technion)
- Raising $500K-$3M (seed/Series A)
- Need growth support beyond capital

**Pain Points:**
- Traditional VCs want 20-30% equity, limited value-add
- Need marketing/tokenomics/GTM support
- Want milestone-based funding (not all upfront)
- Seeking global LP network, not just Israeli capital

**NOTALONE Value Prop:**
> "Apply for $100K-$1M funding. Get embedded growth team (marketing, tokenomics, GTM, partnerships). Milestone-based releases protect both sides. Access 1,000 global LPs, 30+ countries."

**Target:** 5 Pre-TGE projects identified

---

### Tertiary: Israeli Ecosystem Leaders

**Profile:**
- Accelerators (Collider, Colu, 8200 EISP)
- Academic programs (Technion, Weizmann)
- Community organizers, event hosts

**Pain Points:**
- Alumni need funding + growth support
- Limited capacity to support all founders
- Want value-add partnerships (not just sponsorships)

**NOTALONE Value Prop:**
> "We fund your best alumni + provide growth support. You earn 2% referral fee on capital raised. Your program becomes more attractive (funding path + global network)."

**Target:** Map 10 strategic partners, sign 1-2

---

## Core Positioning & Messaging

### What We Are NOT Saying

❌ "Disrupting Israeli VC"
❌ "Democratizing access to deals"
❌ "AI-powered matching"
❌ "Revolutionary platform"

### What We ARE Saying

✅ "LP investment platform with deal-by-deal discretion and 0% management fees"
✅ "VCs can join as LPs with just $10K (not $2M)"

✅ "Built by team that scaled NEAR/ICP globally (10K+ devs trained, 300+ projects)"

### Elevator Pitch (Israeli VC/Angel Version)

> "You want exposure to crypto/AI deals, but don't want to commit $500K to a blind pool VC fund with 2% annual fees.
>
> Join NOTALONE as LP with just $10K. See every deal before voting. 0% management fees (only 20% carry on gains). Invest in RWA, DeAI, BTCfi, AI infrastructure—only the deals YOU choose.
>
> Withdraw unused capital anytime. No 3-year lockup. Deal-by-deal discretion.
>
> Plus: Refer other LPs, earn 5% of their profits. Refer deals, earn 2% of capital raised."

### Elevator Pitch (Israeli Founder Version)

> "You're building a crypto/AI project. You need $500K-$2M for your next stage.
>
> Apply to NOTALONE: Global LP network (1,000 LPs, 30+ countries) votes on your deal. If approved, you get funding + embedded growth team (marketing, tokenomics, GTM, exchange listings).
>
> Milestone-based releases (25% tranches): You unlock capital as you hit milestones. Fair for everyone.
>
> Your Unit 8200 / Weizmann / Technion background? That's a TRUST SIGNAL for global LPs. You're already ahead."

**Conservative (No PR Firm, Minimal Travel): ~$7,000**
**Aggressive (PR Firm, International Travel): ~$16,000**

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Roadshow Attendance

**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach 3 weeks before event (not 1 week)
- Offer VIP 1-on-1 slots to top 10 VCs (exclusive access)
- Partner with Collider/8200 EISP to co-host (leverage their community)
- Free drinks/food (Israelis love free food at events)

---

### Risk 2: VCs Don't Commit (Just Attend for Info)

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-roadshow 1-on-1 calls with top 10 prospects
- Secure 1-2 soft commitments BEFORE event
- At roadshow, announce: "We already have 2 Israeli VCs committed" (social proof)
- Offer limited-time incentive: "First 5 Israeli LPs get 6 months priority deal access"

---

### Risk 3: Founders Don't Apply (See NOTALONE as Foreign Platform)

**Mitigation:**
- Lead with Israeli credibility: "Your Unit 8200 background = global LP trust"
- Show Israeli-friendly terms: Milestone-based (protects both sides)
- Highlight growth support: "We have marketing/GTM team, not just capital"
- Referral from respected Israeli VCs/accelerators (warm intros)

---

### Risk 4: Media Doesn't Cover (Too Many Crypto Platforms)

**Mitigation:**
- Unique angle: "0% management fees, $10K minimum - how Israeli VCs get crypto/AI exposure without $2M commitment"
- Data hook: "NOTALONE data shows Israeli founders 2x more likely to get funded with Unit 8200 background" (if data exists)
- Exclusive access: Offer Calcalist/Geektime first interview, exclusive data
- Leverage your personal story: "Why I'm bringing global LP platform to Israel"

---

### Risk 5: Regulatory Concerns (Israeli Investors Cautious)

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize KYC optional (but may limit deal access)
- Mention legal counsel: Dr. Carolina Rios (12+ years crypto law)
- Position as "global platform, not Israeli fund" (different regulatory treatment)
- Advise LPs to consult their own tax/legal advisors

---
