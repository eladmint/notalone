Medium V2
Notalone is a founder-first investment platform that tears up the old VC rulebook. It charges no management fees (0%) - the fund only profits alongside its founders and LPs on successful outcomes. Its dual fund structure combines a Liquid Fund for agile, short-term opportunities with a Venture Fund for long-horizon bets, giving startups both immediate support and long-term commitment. Unlike traditional funds that demand blind commitments, Notalone deploys capital in tranches tied to milestones. Startups earn their funding round-by-round through hitting key KPIs, ensuring every dollar is backed by real progress. This transparent, milestone based model replaces the blind-pool approach with accountability. And it’s not just theory - Notalone’s team has a proven track record building ecosystems like NEAR, Internet Computer, and Stellar, collectively training over 10,000 developers and launching 300+ projects across 30+ countries, which gives it the credibility to back bold founders on a global scale.

1 Paragraph for LP’s

For LPs, Notalone represents a fundamentally aligned investment platform. It charges a 0% management fee, so the GP earns nothing unless the fund generates profits – a structure increasingly sought by sophisticated investors. The fund’s dual structure marries the fast liquidity and opportunism of a hedge fund with the long-term value creation of a venture fund: a Liquid Fund captures short-term or liquid opportunities (e.g. tokens, secondaries), while a Venture Fund focuses on longer-term equity or token holdings, often co-investing to balance immediate returns with sustained growth. Capital is committed deal-by-deal, not via a blind pool - LPs reserve discretion on each investment. In practice, Notalone presents deals to its LPs and calls capital only when an opportunity meets predefined criteria, rather than drawing down a blind commitment upfront. Moreover, each investment is milestone-based: follow-on funding is contingent on the company achieving key performance milestones, which enforces discipline and mitigates risk by avoiding over-allocation to underperforming assets. This model ensures tight GP-LP alignment - every decision centers on maximizing actual portfolio results, not just deploying capital. Importantly for LPs, Notalone’s team brings an exceptional track record in venture and ecosystem development: they helped launch and grow NEAR’s developer community by 10k+ engineers and 300+ projects, and replicated similar success at DFINITY’s Internet Computer across 30+ countries. This proven execution capability, combined with an innovative fund design, positions Notalone as a compelling addition to an LP’s portfolio, offering both upside alignment and downside protection through its unique structure.

LP Memo 

Fee and Incentive structure - 0% Management fee: Notalone has zero management fees, meaning LPs aren’t paying annual fees on committed capital at all. The only fees come from performance-based carry, aligning the General Partners entirely with the success of the investments. In an industry where the standard 2% management fee can create perverse incentives to gather assets, Notalone’s approach ensures the GP only profits when the LP profits. This isn’t an unproven idea – institutional investors have been pushing for “0-and-30” style models (no base fee, higher carry) to better align incentives - and Notalone is putting that principle front and center. For LPs, this translates to lower drag on returns and higher focus on performance.
Dual Fund Structure - Liquid + Venture: The fund operates a dual vehicle structure: one is a Liquid Fund, the other a Venture Fund. This setup is designed to capture a broader spectrum of opportunities and optimize capital deployment. The Liquid Fund can engage in liquid crypto assets or secondary positions and provide short-term liquidity and tactical investments, effectively functioning with the agility of a hedge fund. Meanwhile, the Venture Fund makes traditional venture-style investments (equity or tokens with lock-ups) for long-term growth. By coordinating these two funds, Notalone can, for example, take a long-term position in a promising startup through the Venture Fund, while the Liquid Fund might participate in token markets or follow-on rounds to manage overall exposure and take advantage of market timing. This barbell strategy of simultaneous long-term and short-term investment activity means the fund can generate interim returns and liquidity (via the Liquid Fund) without sacrificing the upside of longer-term bets. It’s a design that provides cash flow flexibility for LPs and the ability to support portfolio companies through different market conditions, all under one roof.
Milestone-Based Capital Deployment: Rather than the typical model of writing a full check on day one, Notalone uses a milestone-based funding approach for each portfolio company. At the time of initial investment, clear milestones (e.g. prototype completion, user growth targets, revenue milestones, regulatory approvals) are agreed upon. Funding is disbursed in tranches as those milestones are achieved. This approach has multiple benefits for LPs: it reduces upfront capital at risk (if a company underperforms early, Notalone can halt further funding), improves portfolio efficiency, and often leads to better terms (as progress is proven, risk is lowered). Essentially, Notalone doubles as an active portfolio manager, continuously vetting each position’s performance before allocating more capital. The structure creates a natural feedback loop - successful companies get more capital to scale, underperformers are curbed, which in turn boosts the overall portfolio quality. Milestone financing is a practice already seen in venture debt and some accelerator models, and evidence shows it de-risks startup investing by tying capital deployment to de-risking events and KPIs. For LPs, this means Notalone’s fund capital is deployed more judiciously, stretching each dollar further and increasing the odds of outsized returns on the winners.
No Blind-Pool commitments - Deal-by-Deal investing: Perhaps most notably for LPs, Notalone is not a blind-pool fund. In a traditional VC fund, LPs commit capital to a fund without knowing exactly what that money will be invested in - they trust the GP’s strategy and await deployment over the fund’s life. Notalone breaks from this model by operating closer to a pledge fund or deal-by-deal syndicate structure: LPs have visibility into each proposed investment and the option to allocate to each deal. Practically, when Notalone identifies an investment, it shares the opportunity (deal memo, due diligence, milestone plan, etc.) with its LPs, and only calls capital for that deal if it meets the agreed criteria and the LP opts in. This offers LPs an extra layer of control and the ability to tailor their exposure (for example, an LP could choose to skip a deal that doesn’t fit their thesis, or conversely, double down on a deal they find highly attractive). While Notalone provides the curation and access - leveraging the GP’s expertise and network – investors aren’t locked into a 10-year blind pool with no say. This model eliminates blind-pool risk and fosters a true partnership mentality between LPs and the GP. It’s worth noting that this approach requires more engagement from LPs (and substantial work from the GP to syndicate each deal), but Notalone’s value-add is in handling the heavy lifting of sourcing, due diligence, and structuring, while giving LPs the final call. The result is a transparent pipeline of investments where all parties are informed and aligned from the outset.
Team & Track Record: Underpinning Notalone’s innovative fund design is a deep bench of experience in building startup ecosystems and delivering results. The General Partners are not financiers in ivory towers; they are operators who have led large-scale developer and startup growth initiatives in the blockchain/Web3 space. For instance, at NEAR Protocol, members of the Notalone team architected the NEAR Developer Program and University, growing the developer base from virtually zero to over 10,000 developers trained and 1,000+ certified, and helped launch 300+ projects in that ecosystem in one year. This effort involved setting up global hackathons, education pipelines, and an accelerator (NEAR Fellowship and NEAR Certified Entrepreneur programs) – 50% of whose graduates successfully launched on NEAR’s network – seeding what became one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 communities. Likewise, at DFINITY (Internet Computer), the team led a worldwide community expansion, establishing local hubs in 33 countries and training 20k+ developers through 200+ hackathons, resulting in 350+ projects built on ICP and revitalizing its community engagement. They introduced novel programs like decentralized accelerator “Olympus” and multi-country hacker houses (Chain Fusion Hubs) that collectively brought in tens of thousands of participants. These aren’t just vanity numbers – they demonstrate the team’s ability to scale networks, source quality startups, and nurture them to success. The team’s track record spans 30+ countries of ecosystem building, giving Notalone unparalleled reach into emerging tech talent pools. It also means the GPs have firsthand relationships with hundreds of founders, engineers, and even local government and enterprise partners, which can directly benefit Notalone’s portfolio (through deal flow, technical expertise, or business development connections).
In summary, Notalone offers LPs a differentiated venture investment opportunity that addresses many traditional pain points: fee drag, misaligned incentives, blind pool risk, and unchecked capital deployment. Instead, it delivers a model where every stakeholder’s incentives are balanced – GPs win when LPs win, founders get funding when they hit goals, and LPs participate in each investment with eyes wide open. The dual fund structure ensures the strategy can capture value across market cycles (providing both liquidity and growth), while the milestone approach and team experience act as force-multipliers for prudent, high-impact investing. For LPs looking for venture exposure with a more transparent, performance-driven ethos, Notalone presents a compelling, next-generation option. It combines the upside of early-stage tech investing with a thoughtful structure to protect and maximize returns, all executed by a team that has built and backed real technology ecosystems from the ground up. With Notalone, LPs aren’t just committing capital – they’re partnering in a venture model designed for the future of tech investing.
