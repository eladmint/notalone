# Follow-Up Email to Asaf Ofer

**Subject:** Following Up - NOTALONE Info & Israel Visit

---

Hi Asaf,

Great catching up! As promised, here's more context about what we've been building with NOTALONE.

## About NOTALONE

NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and world-class operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We're building infrastructure for early-stage innovation that prioritizes alignment, transparency, and execution. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) through our platform that facilitates fundraising collaboration, and we run a Ventures fund to support the best projects.

NOTALONE operates a dual fund structure optimized for different return profiles: a **Liquid Fund** targeting top-100 OTC deals with short vesting and entry discounts, and a **Venture Fund** targeting early-stage Web3/AI projects. Our investment focus includes RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, and GenAI stacks—areas where Israeli innovation is particularly strong.

Our model creates a flywheel: we source exceptional deals globally, invest through our fund, and open select opportunities to our LP network for co-investment. This generates deal flow visibility, builds trust through co-investment alignment, and creates a natural pipeline for our next fund. We also operate with 0% management fees and milestone-based capital deployment—aligning everyone's incentives around actual performance.

Beyond capital, **NOTALONE Services** provides full-stack operational support to portfolio companies—from GTM strategy and fundraising execution to global network access and ecosystem scaling across 20+ countries. This means our portfolio companies get more than just funding; they get hands-on war partners for growth.

## The Team Behind NOTALONE

What makes NOTALONE different is that our team are operators, not just financiers. We've spent years building startup ecosystems from the ground up:

**At NEAR Protocol**, we architected the NEAR Developer Program and University, growing the developer base from virtually zero to over 10,000 developers trained and 1,000+ certified, and helped launch 300+ projects in one year. We set up global hackathons, education pipelines, and accelerators—50% of whose graduates successfully launched on NEAR's network.

**At DFINITY (Internet Computer)**, we led worldwide community expansion, establishing local hubs in 33 countries and training 20k+ developers through 200+ hackathons, resulting in 350+ projects built on ICP. We introduced programs like the decentralized accelerator "Olympus" and multi-country hacker houses (Chain Fusion Hubs).

This track record across 30+ countries means we have firsthand relationships with hundreds of founders, engineers, and ecosystem partners globally—which directly benefits our deal flow, due diligence, and portfolio support.

**The core team includes:**

- **David Shengart** (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit
- **Clement Chaikov** (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit
- **Elad Miron** (myself): Led the ICP hub in Germany working with the team on ecosystem expansion, prior experience as Celo Foundation ambassador in Berlin

## Recent Validation & Traction

The market is validating our approach:

- **ECHO acquisition by Coinbase ($375M)** - During our US roadshow, a simpler version of our platform model was acquired, demonstrating the value proposition we're building at scale
- **Strong institutional partnerships** - SF-based Fund of Funds ($8B AUM) and NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM) actively participating in our deals
- **Global expansion momentum** - Active roadshows across Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, with Davos scheduled

Our fund performance backs this up: OpenXAI delivered 7x realized returns and 20x unrealized, we've closed a 50% discount OTC deal with 50% principal already recovered, and we have $50-80M in liquidity deals progressing across top-100 CMC projects. We have 2 TGEs scheduled in Q4 2025 and 4 more in Q1 2026.

## Israel Visit: Nov 24-30

Clement and I will be in Israel during this window. Despite the challenging political situation, we see this as exactly the right time to show up—showing conviction when others pull back, and building relationships with founders who will remember who was there during difficult times.

Would love to catch up while we're there and hear more about what you're building at your AI startup.

Let me know what works for your schedule!

Best regards,
Elad
