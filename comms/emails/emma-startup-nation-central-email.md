# Email to Emma - Startup Nation Central

**Subject:** Israel Visit Nov 24-30 - Reconnecting & Requesting Support

---

Hi Emma,

I hope this email finds you well. I recently had a call with Jeremie Kletzkine about our upcoming Israel visit, and he suggested I reach out to you directly.

By way of background, I used to work with Jeremie before COVID on Chinese business delegations to Israel, so it's great to reconnect with Startup Nation Central after all these years—especially at a time when international investors visiting Israel is less common.

## Quick Intro to NOTALONE

NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) and operate a dual structure: a Liquid Fund for top-100 OTC deals and a Venture Fund for early-stage Web3/AI projects.

**What makes us different:** Our team spent years building ecosystems at NEAR and DFINITY (Internet Computer)—we trained 30k+ developers across 30+ countries and helped launch 650+ projects. We're operators first, investors second. Beyond capital, we provide full-stack operational support through NOTALONE Services.

**The core team:**
- **David Shengart** (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit
- **Clement Chaikov** (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit
- **Elad Miron** (myself): Led the ICP hub in Germany working with the team on ecosystem expansion, prior experience as Celo Foundation ambassador in Berlin

**Investment focus:** RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, GenAI stacks.

**Recent traction:**
- OpenXAI: 7x realized, 20x unrealized
- Strong institutional partnerships: SF-based FoFs ($8B AUM), NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM)
- Active global roadshows: Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, Davos

## Israel Visit: Nov 24-30

Clement and I will be in Israel during this window. Despite the challenging political situation, we see this as exactly the right time to show up—showing conviction when others pull back, and building relationships with founders who will remember who was there during difficult times.

We're looking to connect with key players in the Israeli Web3 ecosystem—particularly companies focused on security infrastructure, privacy tech (FHE/ZK), RWA tokenization, and DeFi infrastructure. We're interested in both established leaders and high-potential emerging companies.

## How Startup Nation Central Can Help

Given SNC's role in connecting international investors with the Israeli tech ecosystem, I'd greatly value your assistance with:

1. **Introductions to relevant Web3/AI companies** - Particularly those solving hard infrastructure problems in security, privacy tech, RWA, and DeFi
2. **Ecosystem mapping guidance** - Leveraging your Finder platform and expertise to identify must-meet companies
3. **Potential roundtable or meeting facilitation** - If there's an opportunity to connect with multiple companies or ecosystem players through SNC's facilities

We're also interested in exploring how NOTALONE can support the Israeli ecosystem beyond this visit—both through investment and our full-stack services for helping Israeli companies scale globally.

Would you be open to a call before our visit to discuss how we can work together? Or if you have availability during Nov 24-30, I'd love to meet in person at SNC's offices.

Looking forward to reconnecting and working together!

Best regards,
Elad
