Hi Adam,

Great talking yesterday and connecting again. I wanted to follow up with more context about NOTALONE and our upcoming Israel visit.

About NOTALONE
NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders and world-class operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We’re building infrastructure for early-stage innovation that prioritizes alignment, transparency, and execution. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) across two models: NOTALONE Ventures (our managed fund) and the NOTALONE Platform (where LPs manage their own investments deal-by-deal with our due diligence and infrastructure).

Similar to Collider, NOTALONE operates a dual fund structure optimized for different return profiles: a Liquid Fund targeting top-100 OTC deals with short vesting and entry discounts, and a Venture Fund targeting early-stage Web3/AI projects. Our investment focus includes RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, and GenAI stacks—areas where Israeli innovation is particularly strong.

Our model creates a flywheel: we source exceptional deals globally, invest through our fund, and open select opportunities to our LP network for co-investment. This generates deal flow visibility, builds trust through co-investment alignment, and creates a natural pipeline for our next fund. We also operate with 0% management fees and milestone-based capital deployment—aligning everyone's incentives around actual performance.

Beyond capital, NOTALONE Services provides full-stack operational support to portfolio companies—from GTM strategy and fundraising execution to global network access and ecosystem scaling across 20+ countries. This means our portfolio companies get more than just funding; they get hands-on war partners for growth.

The Team Behind NOTALONE
What makes NOTALONE different is that our team are operators, not just financiers. We've spent years building startup ecosystems from the ground up:

At NEAR Protocol, we architected the NEAR Developer Program and University, growing the developer base from virtually zero to over 10,000 developers trained and 1,000+ certified, and helped launch 300+ projects in one year. We set up global hackathons, education pipelines, and accelerators—50% of whose graduates successfully launched on NEAR's network.

At DFINITY (Internet Computer), we led worldwide community expansion, establishing local hubs in 33 countries and training 20k+ developers through 200+ hackathons, resulting in 350+ projects built on ICP. We introduced programs like the decentralized accelerator "Olympus" and multi-country hacker houses (Chain Fusion Hubs).

This track record across 30+ countries means we have firsthand relationships with hundreds of founders, engineers, and ecosystem partners globally—which directly benefits our deal flow, due diligence, and portfolio support.

The core team includes:

David Shengart (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit.

Clement Chaikov (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit.

Recent Validation & Traction
The market is validating our approach:

ECHO acquisition by Coinbase ($375M) - During our US roadshow, a simpler version of our platform model was acquired, demonstrating the value proposition we're building at scale

Strong institutional partnerships - SF-based Fund of Funds ($8B AUM) and NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM) actively participating in our deals

Global expansion momentum - Active roadshows across Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, with Davos scheduled

Our fund performance backs this up: OpenXAI delivered 7x realized returns and 20x unrealized, we've closed a 50% discount OTC deal with 50% principal already recovered, and we have $50-80M in liquidity deals progressing across top-100 CMC projects. We have 2 TGEs scheduled in Q4 2025 and 4 more in Q1 2026.

Why We're Coming to Israel Now
Clement and I will be in Israel Nov 24-30. Israel is going through a globally challenging political time, and it's rare to see international VCs coming to the region because of it. For us, this is exactly why NOTALONE should be there—showing conviction when others pull back, and building relationships with founders who will remember who showed up during difficult times.

Beyond the business opportunity, this is primarily a learning expedition. I’d like Clement and the rest of the team to deeply understand the Web3 potential of the Startup Nation—not just meet companies looking to raise funds, but also meet leading and up-and-coming companies that can shed light on what makes Israel's ecosystem unique. 

How You Can Help
I'd greatly value your guidance and assitance on two things:

1. Introductions to emerging companies We'd love warm introductions to high-potential emerging companies solving hard infrastructure problems—companies like FHEenix, Hypernative, Certora, SSV Network, and others you think we should meet. We're particularly interested in security infrastructure, privacy tech (FHE/ZK), RWA tokenization, and DeFi critical infrastructure.

2. Co-organizing an event together I understand Collider organizes events for your portfolio and partners regularly. We'd love to explore co-organizing your next event together during our visit (Nov 24-30). This could be a great way to introduce NOTALONE's LP network to the Israeli ecosystem and demonstrate potential synergies.

Looking forward to working together and learning from the ecosystem you've been building.

Best regards, 

Elad
