Hi Roei,

Really great catching up on the call! I wanted to follow up with more context about what we've been building with NOTALONE and our upcoming Israel visit.

About NOTALONE
NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and world-class operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We're building infrastructure for early-stage innovation that prioritizes alignment, transparency, and execution. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) across two models: NOTALONE Ventures (our managed fund) and the NOTALONE Platform (where LPs manage their own investments deal-by-deal with our due diligence and infrastructure).

NOTALONE operates a dual fund structure optimized for different return profiles: a Liquid Fund targeting top-100 OTC deals with short vesting and entry discounts, and a Venture Fund targeting early-stage Web3/AI projects. Our investment focus includes RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, and GenAI stacks—areas where Israeli innovation is particularly strong.

Beyond capital, NOTALONE Services provides full-stack operational support to portfolio companies—from GTM strategy and fundraising execution to global network access and ecosystem scaling across 20+ countries. This means our portfolio companies get more than just funding; they get hands-on war partners for growth.

The Team Behind NOTALONE
What makes NOTALONE different is that our team are operators, not just financiers. We've spent years building startup ecosystems from the ground up:

At NEAR Protocol, we architected the NEAR Developer Program and University, growing the developer base from virtually zero to over 10,000 developers trained and 1,000+ certified, and helped launch 300+ projects in one year. We set up global hackathons, education pipelines, and accelerators—50% of whose graduates successfully launched on NEAR's network.

At DFINITY (Internet Computer), we led worldwide community expansion, establishing local hubs in 33 countries and training 20k+ developers through 200+ hackathons, resulting in 350+ projects built on ICP. We introduced programs like the decentralized accelerator "Olympus" and multi-country hacker houses (Chain Fusion Hubs).

This track record across 30+ countries means we have firsthand relationships with hundreds of founders, engineers, and ecosystem partners globally—which directly benefits our deal flow, due diligence, and portfolio support.

The core team includes:

David Shengart (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit
Clement Chaikov (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit.
Recent Validation & Traction
The market is validating our approach:

ECHO acquisition by Coinbase ($375M) - During our US roadshow, a simpler version of our platform model was acquired, demonstrating the value proposition we're building at scale
Strong institutional partnerships - SF-based Fund of Funds ($8B AUM) and NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM) actively participating in our deals
Global expansion momentum - Active roadshows across Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, with Davos scheduled
Our fund performance backs this up: OpenXAI delivered 7x realized returns and 20x unrealized, we've closed a 50% discount OTC deal with 50% principal already recovered, and we have $50-80M in liquidity deals progressing across top-100 CMC projects. We have 2 TGEs scheduled in Q4 2025 and 4 more in Q1 2026.

Potential Synergies
Looking ahead, I see some interesting potential synergies between NOTALONE and Efficient Frontier:

Liquidity for our portfolio companies - As our portfolio companies approach TGE, having relationships with top-tier market makers like Efficient Frontier would be incredibly valuable
Deal flow sharing - We're seeing early-stage projects across our global network that might benefit from Efficient Frontier's expertise as they mature
LP introductions - Some of our institutional LPs are actively looking for sophisticated crypto trading strategies and market-making partnerships
Israel Visit: Nov 24-30
Clement and I will be in Israel during this window. Israel is going through a globally challenging political time, and it's rare to see international VCs coming to the region because of it. For us, this is exactly why NOTALONE should be there—showing conviction when others pull back, and building relationships.

As you mentioned on the call, I understand you won't be available during Nov 24-30, but I'd love to connect with Erez if he's around. Beyond that, your assistance with introductions to the Israeli Web3 ecosystem would be incredibly valuable.

We're particularly interested in connecting with:

Companies focused on security infrastructure, privacy tech, RWA tokenization, and DeFi infrastructure.
High-potential emerging companies solving hard infrastructure problems.
Key ecosystem players and other market makers/liquidity providers in the space.
Any warm introductions you can facilitate would be greatly appreciated!

Would be great to explore these further when our schedules align. In the meantime, looking forward to potentially meeting Erez during our visit!

Best regards, 

Elad
