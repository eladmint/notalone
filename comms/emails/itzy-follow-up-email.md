Hi Itzy,

Great catching up today! Really appreciate you taking the time to chat and offering to help connect us with relevant people during our Israel visit.

## Quick Intro to NOTALONE

NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) and operate a dual structure: a Liquid Fund for top-100 OTC deals and a Venture Fund for early-stage Web3/AI projects.

**What makes us different:** Our team spent years building ecosystems at NEAR and DFINITY (Internet Computer)—we trained 30k+ developers across 30+ countries and helped launch 650+ projects. We're operators first, investors second. Beyond capital, we provide full-stack operational support through NOTALONE Services.

**The core team:**
- **David Shengart** (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen
- **Clement Chaikov** (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit
- **Elad Miron** (myself): Led the ICP hub in Germany working with the team on ecosystem expansion, prior experience as Celo Foundation ambassador in Berlin

**Investment focus:** RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, GenAI stacks.

**Recent traction:**
- OpenXAI: 7x realized, 20x unrealized
- Strong institutional partnerships: SF-based FoFs ($8B AUM), NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM)
- Active global roadshows: Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, Davos

## Israel Visit: Nov 24-30

Clement and I will be in Israel during this window. Despite the challenging political situation, we see this as exactly the right time to show up—building relationships with founders who will remember who was there during difficult times.

We're looking to connect with key players in the Israeli Web3 ecosystem—particularly companies focused on security infrastructure, privacy tech (FHE/ZK), RWA tokenization, and DeFi infrastructure.

Beyond just exploring investment opportunities, we're interested in understanding how NOTALONE can support the ecosystem through both capital and our full-stack services (GTM, fundraising execution, global network access across 20+ countries).

Would love to grab coffee when we're there and get your thoughts on who we should meet. Any introductions to founders, ecosystem builders, or others working in the space would be incredibly valuable.

Tuesday Nov 25 works great! Would 11am or 1pm work for you? Happy to come by your office.

Best,
Elad
