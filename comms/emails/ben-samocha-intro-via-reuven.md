# Email to Reuven - Ben Samocha Introduction

**Subject:** Israel Visit Nov 24-30 - Ben Samocha Introduction

---

Hi Reuven,

Thanks so much for offering to introduce me to Ben Samocha. I'd really appreciate the connection!

Here's some context you can share:

## Quick Intro to NOTALONE

NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) and operate a dual structure: a Liquid Fund for top-100 OTC deals and a Venture Fund for early-stage Web3/AI projects.

**What makes us different:** Our team spent years building ecosystems at NEAR and DFINITY (Internet Computer)—we trained 30k+ developers across 30+ countries and helped launch 650+ projects. We're operators first, investors second. Beyond capital, we provide full-stack operational support through NOTALONE Services.

**The core team:**
- **David Shengart** (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit
- **Clement Chaikov** (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit
- **Elad Miron** (myself): Led the ICP hub in Germany working with the team on ecosystem expansion, prior experience as Celo Foundation ambassador in Berlin

**Investment focus:** RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, GenAI stacks.

**Recent traction:**
- OpenXAI: 7x realized, 20x unrealized
- Strong institutional partnerships: SF-based FoFs ($8B AUM), NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM)
- Active global roadshows: Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, Davos

## Israel Visit: Nov 24-30

Clement (our Network Architect) and I will be in Israel during this window. Despite the challenging political situation, we see this as exactly the right time to show up—building relationships with founders who will remember who was there during difficult times.

We're looking to connect with key ecosystem players, explore investment opportunities in Israeli Web3 companies (particularly those focused on security infrastructure, privacy tech, RWA tokenization, and DeFi infrastructure), and understand how NOTALONE can support the Israeli startup ecosystem through both capital and our full-stack services.

## Why Connect with Ben

Given Ben's role as CEO of CryptoJungle and his deep connections in the Israeli Web3 community (including his work with Collider, Fireblocks, and organizing Crypto Aid Israel), I'd love to connect with him to get his perspective on the ecosystem and introductions to high-potential companies we should meet during our visit.

Would you be open to making an introduction? Happy to schedule around Ben's availability.

Thanks again for the support, Reuven!

Best,
Elad

**Note to Elad:** I left a placeholder for "Why Connect with Ben" - let me know what Ben Samocha does or why you want to meet him, and I'll fill in that section appropriately.
