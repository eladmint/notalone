## The Problem Israeli Investors Face

### Traditional VC/Fund Model Sucks

**Blind Pools = Blind Bets**
- You commit $500K-$2M to a fund
- GP decides which deals to invest in
- You have ZERO say in individual deals
- 68% of institutional LPs cite lack of transparency as #1 concern

*(Source: LP deck page 4, PitchBook 2024)*

**Management Fees Kill Returns**
- 2% annual management fee whether fund performs or not
- $1M commitment = $20K/year in fees for 10 years = $200K gone
- GP makes money on AUM, not outcomes

*(Source: LP deck page 4)*

**Crypto VC Underperformance**
- Median crypto VC fund underperformed BTC and ETH last cycle
- 90% of Web3 deals fail to deliver meaningful returns
- 88% of tokens collapse

*(Source: LP deck page 3)*

**Capital Lock-Up**
- 3-4 year lockup typical
- Can't exit even if you see red flags
- Forced to watch your money sit in dead deals

*(Source: MASTER_NARRATIVE_FINAL.md line 166)*

---

### What This Means for Israeli VCs

You want to:
- Deploy capital into crypto/AI deals
- But NOT commit $2M to a blind pool
- See deals BEFORE investing
- Keep optionality and flexibility
- Avoid 2% annual management fees

**Traditional solution:** Launch your own fund (expensive, time-consuming, regulatory headaches)

**NOTALONE solution:** Join as an LP, invest deal-by-deal starting from $10K

---

### What This Means for Israeli Angels/LPs

You want to:
- Access top-tier crypto/AI deal flow
- Co-invest with experienced investors
- Vote on which deals to back
- Protect downside (milestone-based funding)

**Traditional solution:** Wait for warm intros, miss most deals, no protection

**NOTALONE solution:** Global deal flow, community voting, milestone-based capital release

---

### What This Means for Israeli Founders

You need:
- Smart capital (not just money)
- Growth support (marketing, tokenomics, GTM, partnerships)
- Fair terms (not predatory VCs)
- Milestone-based funding (not all upfront)

**Traditional solution:** Give away 20-30% to VCs, limited support, all capital upfront

**NOTALONE solution:** Embedded growth team, milestone-based releases, aligned incentives
