## 1. Deal Types

We engage with projects in three ways:

| Type | Description | Criteria |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Investment** | Primary focus | Token project, fits strategy |
| **Services** | Help as service providers | Projects we can support |
| **Showcase** | Pipeline for investor visibility | Strong deals that don't fit our strategy |

**Rule:** We only invest in token projects. Equity-only projects go to Showcase.

---

## 2. Kill Criteria (Immediate Reject)

Stop evaluation immediately if ANY of these apply:

| Criteria | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Equity-only (no token) | → Showcase only |
| Gaming project | → REJECT |
| Metaverse project | → REJECT |
| NFT project | → REJECT |
| Anonymous team | → REJECT |
| No clear product/problem | → REJECT |
| Direct clone without differentiation | → REJECT |
| Unrealistic/unjustified projections | → REJECT |
| FDV > $100M | → REJECT (rare exceptions) |
| >6 months without product or traction | → RED FLAG |

---

## 3. Industry Priorities

### Actively Like
- RWA (Real World Assets)
- AI
- DePIN
- Innovative DeFi
- Stablecoins and Payments
- Privacy
- Trading Infrastructure
- Non-gaming consumer apps with traction
- Native Web3 industries

### Do NOT Consider
- Gaming
- Metaverse
- NFT projects
- Launchpads (very light consideration only)

### Neutral
All other non-excluded sectors are open for consideration.

---

## 4. Valuation Filters

### Entry FDV by Stage

| Stage | Preferred | Maximum |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Pre-seed | $10-15M | $15M |
| Seed | $25-40M (≤$30M ideal) | $40M |
| Exceptions | - | $70-100M (outstanding DD + hedge access only) |

### Launch FDV

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Preferred FDV at TGE | ≤$50M |
| Exception cases | $50-100M (rare) |
| Entry→TGE Multiple | Minimum 1.5x, ideally 2-4x |

### Valuation Framework Formula

```
Required Entry→TGE Multiple ≈ 1 / (1 + P50 at horizon)

Examples:
- Acc Above, 180d: P50 ≈ −35% → need ~1.54× uplift
- Bear, 365d: P50 ≈ −75% → need ~3.97×
- Bull Run, 545d: P50 ≈ −80% → need ~5.08×
```

## 5. Token & Timing Requirements

### TGE Timing

| Preference | Timeline |
|------------|----------|
| Preferred | H1 2026 |
| Acceptable | H2 2026 (special cases only) |
| Ideal from investment | 3-6 months to TGE |

### Unlock Schedule Requirements

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| TGE Unlock | ≥10% minimum, 20% ideal |
| Cliff | ≤3 months preferred |
| Full Unlock | ≤18 months post-TGE |
| Vesting | Linear weekly/bi-weekly preferred |

### Current Fund Notes (Until Feb 2026)
- Max lockup: 2 months from investment
- Target: Net out of investment in 4-6 months
- Prefer lockup from day of investment (not TGE)
- Include refund rules if TGE delays >30 days

---

## 6. OTC Deal Criteria

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Minimum Discount | 30% |
| Preferred Discount | 50%+ |
| Full Unlock | 6-9 months |

---

## 7. Hedging Requirements

**Critical:** A deal is NOT viable unless hedging is possible.

### Precondition
Token must be confirmed to list on a centralized exchange with liquid perpetual futures.

### Hedging Strategy (VWAP-Based)
- **Anchor:** VWAP from TGE (volume-weighted average price since listing)
- **Trigger ON:** Daily close below VWAP → Put hedge on (full notional)
- **Trigger OFF:** Daily close above VWAP → Remove hedge

### Risk Controls
- Move stop to breakeven if hedge moves ~10% in favor
- Scale profits at −20% / −40% / −60% from short entry
- Exit hedge if price closes back above VWAP
- Funding cap: Do not carry short costing >20-30% annualized

---

## 8. Traction & Social Proof

### Traction Requirements

| Factor | Preference |
|--------|------------|
| Real traction | Preferred (not partnerships, not social metrics) |
| Lack of traction | Not automatic rejection, but scrutinized |
| Product stage | MVP/testnet public, accessible, functional |
| Growth source | Product-driven, not airdrop-driven |

### Social Proof

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Tier-1/Tier-2 investors | Bonus, not requirement |
| Strategic partners | Positive signal |
| Media coverage | Positive signal |

---

## 9. Ideal Project Profile

A strong investment candidate looks like:

| Attribute | Ideal Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| Operating time | 12+ months |
| Product | Live with early traction, signs of PMF |
| Sector | Native Web3, hot sector (not gaming) |
| Team | Known, validated, relevant experience |
| Token launch | ~6 months from investment |
| Tokenomics | 3-month cliff, 10% TGE, 12-month vesting |
| Valuation | $25-40M current, ~$15M previous round |
| Investors | Tier-2 funds in previous round |
| Runway | Can reach TGE without new funding |
| Community | Growth driven by product, not airdrops |

## 12. Market Regime Framework

### Five Market Regimes

| Regime | Description | Duration | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Accumulation Below** | Bottoming phase, improving risk appetite | ~300 days | Long lockups (12-18 months) |
| **Just Growth** | Steady up-drift, no euphoria | ~134 days | AVOID (or short lockups with 70-80% discount) |
| **Accumulation Above** | Early breakout, strength building | ~75 days | Short lockups |
| **Bull Run** | Persistent upside, euphoria | ~126 days | Very short lockups + strict hedge |
| **Bear Market** | Persistent downtrend, risk aversion | ~221 days | AVOID (or huge discounts) |

### Regime Transitions (Most Frequent)
```
Just Growth → Bear 60% | Acc Above 40%
Acc Above → Bull Run 67% | Just Growth 33%
Bull Run → Bear 100%
Bear → Just Growth 60% | Acc Below 40%
Acc Below → Just Growth 100%
```

### Investment Timing Strategy
- Target Accumulation Above (short lockups): Invest during Just Growth
- Target Bull Run (fast liquidity): Invest during Accumulation Above
- Target Accumulation Below (long lockups): Invest during Bear Market
