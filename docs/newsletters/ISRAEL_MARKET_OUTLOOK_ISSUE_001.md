## From the Desk of [GP Name]

In the past 12 months, four acquisitions tell the same story:

- Paxos acquired Fordefi ($100M+)
- Fireblocks acquired Dynamic (~$90M)
- Chainalysis acquired Alterya (~$150M)
- Chainalysis acquired Hexagate (~$60M)

Different acquirers. Same talent pool. Same region.

This issue explores why the world's largest crypto infrastructure companies keep acquiring from Tel Aviv—and what it means for our thesis.

### Where Protocol-Level Innovation Keeps Emerging

**The Acquisition Pattern:**

| Target | Acquirer | Amount | Date |
|--------|----------|--------|------|
| Fordefi | Paxos | ~$100M+ | Nov 2025 |
| Dynamic | Fireblocks | ~$90M | Oct 2025 |
| Alterya | Chainalysis | ~$150M | Jan 2025 |
| Hexagate | Chainalysis | ~$60M | Dec 2024 |
| Curv | PayPal | $200M | 2021 |
| Unbound Security | Coinbase | $100M+ | 2022 |

**Why This Region?**

The answer isn't geopolitics—it's academic heritage.

Tel Aviv sits at the center of one of the world's densest cryptography research ecosystems. Adi Shamir—the "S" in RSA encryption, which secures the entire internet—is a professor at Weizmann Institute. Zero-knowledge proofs, now foundational to zkRollups and blockchain privacy, emerged from research at Weizmann and Technion.

This academic pipeline produces founders who don't build apps—they build the infrastructure apps depend on. StarkWare ($8B valuation) invented STARKs. Fireblocks ($8B valuation) built institutional custody. Bancor invented automated market makers.

When acquirers buy these companies, they're not just buying technology. They're buying access to a research-to-company pipeline that takes decades to replicate.

**The Thesis:**

Academic cryptography heritage creates founders who build protocol-level infrastructure. Major acquirers know where to shop. This is the ecosystem we focus on.

## Israel Insider

### The Serial Founder Pattern

This ecosystem produces founders who don't stop after one exit. Verified examples:

**Assaf Rappaport**
- First exit: Adallom → Microsoft ($320M, 2015)
- Current: Wiz (valued at $12B+, largest cybersecurity company from the region)
- Multiple: ~37x larger than first exit

**Mickey Boodaei**
- First exit: Trusteer → IBM (~$1B, 2013)
- Current: Transmit Security (valued at $2.1B+)
- Multiple: ~2x larger than first exit

**Shlomo Kramer** ("Godfather of Israeli cybersecurity")
- First: Check Point (co-founder, 1993, IPO)
- Then: Imperva (founder, later acquired)
- Current: Cato Networks (valued at $3B+)

This pattern matters because successful founders attract better talent, have stronger investor networks, and make fewer first-time mistakes. When evaluating opportunities, we track founders with this trajectory.
