# Questions for LP Deck Workshop - Elad

**Document:** Feedback and Questions for NOTALONE LP Deck
**Prepared by:** Elad (Israel Ecosystem Partner)
**Date:** December 28, 2024
**For:** NOTALONE Fund Model & Fundraising Workshop

---

## Context

These questions focus specifically on the LP deck content and how to strengthen it for investor conversations. I'm approaching this assuming the fund is one component of NOTALONE's broader platform/collective vision, with the Services offering and ecosystem network remaining core to our differentiated positioning.

**Overall Assessment:** After researching industry standards, the fund structure is largely sound and follows established practices for hybrid liquid/venture crypto funds. The questions below focus on areas that could be strengthened for sophisticated LP conversations.

---

## What's Working Well (Industry-Validated)

Before diving into questions, it's worth noting what aligns with industry standards:

| Element | Industry Context | Assessment |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **3-Year Duration** | Standard for liquid/hybrid crypto funds (vs 10-year for pure venture) | Appropriate for 80% liquid strategy |
| **0% Management Fee** | Rare (<5% of funds) but legitimate LP-friendly innovation | Strong differentiator |
| **20% Carry** | Industry standard | Non-issue |
| **BVI Structure** | ~15-20% of crypto funds; US investors can access via Reg D | Completely standard |
| **OTC Vesting (3.5 months)** | Post-TGE OTC deals typically 0-12 months; a16z "4-year" standard is for pre-launch only | Within market norms |

---

## Deck-Specific Questions

### 1. "Be Long" Tagline vs. 3-Year Structure (Slides 1, 25-26)

The "Be long, don't do investment alone" tagline is powerful and differentiating. While the 3-year duration is appropriate for a liquid-heavy strategy, sophisticated LPs may still ask: **"How does a 3-year fund demonstrate long-term commitment?"**

The deck addresses this on Slide 26 ("Why a 3-Year Fund"), explaining that edges in crypto aren't decade-long and the fund is "built for the actual cycle." This is a valid argument.

- **Suggestion:** Consider adding language that connects the 3-year fund to NOTALONE's broader, long-term platform commitment. Something like: "The fund is cycle-specific, but NOTALONE's support for founders extends beyond any single fund."
- This would bridge the tagline promise with the fund mechanics without changing the structure.

---

### 2. Track Record Depth (Slides 37, 39) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

The deck shows 2 case studies with strong results (5x realized, 1.5x pending). For a $100M raise, LPs typically want to see deeper track record evidence.

#### What's Currently Documented (Strong)

| Category | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Ecosystem Credentials** | 30,000+ developers trained (NEAR + ICP), 650+ projects launched, 200+ hackathons, 30+ countries |
| **Recent Investments** | Investment 1: 5x realized (Feb 2025), Investment 2: 1.5x pending (Jun 2025) |
| **OTC Strategy** | Backtested 33 deals showing +12% with VWAP hedging vs -14% buy-and-hold |
| **Team Roles** | David/Viktor @ Unicorn Factory Ventures, Shashi @ DFINITY/NEAR |
| **Network** | 1,000+ pipeline (funds, accelerators, founders) |

#### What's Missing (Critical Gaps)

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Unicorn Factory Ventures returns** | HIGH | David & Viktor's prior fund - no IRR/MOIC documented |
| **"$50M+ deployed at NEAR/ICP" detail** | HIGH | Claim exists in strategy docs but not quantified |
| **Additional case studies** | MEDIUM | Only 2 examples; need 3-5 for $100M raise |
| **Team attribution** | LOW | Which team member worked on which deals |

#### Recommended Talking Point

> "Our team has trained 30,000+ developers and launched 650+ projects across NEAR and ICP ecosystems. Our recent investments show 5x and 1.5x returns. We're operators who build ecosystems, not just capital allocators."

#### Questions for Workshop

- **Question:** Can we get historical performance data from Unicorn Factory Ventures (IRR, MOIC, notable exits)?
- **Question:** Can we detail the "$50M+ deployed at NEAR/ICP" claim with specific projects and outcomes?
- **Suggestion:** Add 1-2 slides as a track record appendix with quantified GP performance

---

### 3. Risk Management Framework (Slides 30-34)

The 80% Liquid Alpha allocation is the fund's primary return driver. Slide 31 mentions "unified risk management + position sizing framework" and Slide 34 mentions "risk-controlled, position-capped, and hedged when applicable."

LPs conducting due diligence will want specifics:

- **Question:** Is there a separate risk management document that details:
  - Position sizing limits (max % per position)
  - Stop-loss frameworks
  - Maximum drawdown thresholds
  - Concentration limits per token/protocol
  - Hedging criteria and instruments used
- **Suggestion:** Even a one-slide summary of risk parameters in the appendix would strengthen institutional confidence. This is especially important given the liquid-heavy strategy.

---

### 4. Cycle Thesis Contingency (Slides 14-15)

The fund strategy is explicitly tied to the 2026-2028 cycle thesis, with deployment in Q3 2026 - Q4 2027 and exits by end of 2029.

- **Question:** What's our response if an LP asks: "What happens if your macro timing is wrong? What if the Fed stability window doesn't materialize as expected?"
- The cycle thesis is well-reasoned, but having a documented downside scenario and adjustment mechanism would strengthen the pitch.

---

### 5. Case Study Context (Slide 37) - Minor Clarification

Investment 2 shows 3.5-month vesting with 25% day-zero release. **Note:** After researching industry norms, this is within standard range for post-TGE OTC deals (which typically have 0-12 month vesting vs 3-4 years for pre-launch SAFTs).

However, some LPs may not know this distinction:

- **Suggestion:** Consider adding a brief label or footnote clarifying this was a "Liquid Investment OTC" deal, which naturally has different vesting dynamics than seed investments. This preempts potential confusion.

---

## Strategic Discussion: Positioning

### The Naming Question

The fund is called "NOTALONE **Ventures**" but the strategy is 80% liquid OTC positions in post-TGE tokens. Research shows this may create a naming-strategy mismatch:

| Signal | "Ventures" Implies | NOTALONE Reality |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Stage | Seed/Series A | Post-TGE (80%) |
| Asset | Equity/SAFTs | Liquid tokens |
| Duration | 7-10 years | 3 years |
| Liquidity | Illiquid | Active trading |

**Industry Precedent:** Comparable funds use different naming:
- Pantera **Liquid Token Fund** (liquid strategy)
- DWF Labs **Liquid Fund** ($250M OTC-focused)
- Funds ending in "Capital" or "Partners" for hybrid strategies

### Options for Discussion

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **NOTALONE Growth** | Signals post-TGE stage; matches team's ecosystem-building strength | Less common in crypto |
| **NOTALONE Liquid** | Maximum clarity on asset type; precedent (Pantera, DWF) | Sounds like hedge fund |
| **Keep "Ventures"** | No rebrand needed; brand continuity | Requires explaining mismatch |

**Question for Workshop:** Should we consider renaming to better match the 80% liquid/OTC strategy? Or is "Ventures" important for brand continuity?

## Target Portfolio Companies: Who We Invest In

Understanding WHO needs OTC capital helps clarify NOTALONE's value proposition for LP conversations.

### Four Personas

| Persona | Situation | What They Need | NOTALONE Fit |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Growth-Starved** | Good tech, flat adoption | Developer ecosystem, GTM | Excellent (30K devs) |
| **Liquidity-Challenged** | Treasury-heavy, cash-light | Capital + operational support | Good (hedged approach) |
| **Strategic Upgrader** | PMF achieved, seeking scale | Enterprise access, global network | Strong (govt deals) |
| **Pivot Seeker** | Narrative obsolescence | Ecosystem expansion, refresh | Excellent (multi-chain) |

### The Match

| NOTALONE Capability | Portfolio Company Need |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| 30,000+ developers trained | Ecosystem adoption |
| 650+ projects launched | GTM playbook |
| Government deal experience | Enterprise access |
| 30+ country network | Geographic expansion |

**Deck Suggestion:** Consider a slide showing this match explicitly - "Here's who we invest in, here's what they need, here's what we bring."

---

## Potential LP Questions to Prepare For

| Question | Deck Reference | Suggested Preparation |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| "How is 3-year long-term?" | Slide 1 vs 25-26 | Connect fund cycle to broader platform commitment |
| "Only 2 case studies - what's your full track record?" | Slide 37 | Use ecosystem talking point + request Unicorn Factory data |
| "What did you do at Unicorn Factory Ventures?" | Slide 39 | Get IRR/MOIC data from David & Viktor |
| "What does '$50M deployed at NEAR/ICP' mean?" | Team claims | Detail specific projects and outcomes |
| "What are your specific risk controls?" | Slides 30-34 | Have detailed risk framework document ready |
| "What if the cycle thesis is wrong?" | Slides 14-15 | Prepare downside scenario and adjustment response |
| "Why call it 'Ventures' if 80% is liquid?" | Fund name | Either rebrand or prepare clear explanation |

---

## Suggestions for Deck Strengthening

1. **Track Record Appendix** - Add 1-2 slides with historical GP performance data (highest priority)

2. **Risk Management Summary** - One-slide overview of position sizing, drawdown limits, hedging policies

3. **Platform Continuity Language** - Bridge "Be long" tagline to broader NOTALONE commitment beyond fund lifecycle

4. **Portfolio Company Fit Slide** - Show the match between who we invest in and what we bring

5. **OTC Context Label** - Minor clarification on case study that it's post-TGE OTC (optional)

---

## Summary

The fund structure is sound and aligns with industry standards for hybrid liquid/venture crypto funds. The 0% management fee is a genuine differentiator, and the 3-year duration is appropriate for the strategy.

**Key Strength:** The team has exceptional ecosystem credentials (30,000+ developers trained, 650+ projects launched). The "operators, not allocators" positioning is a genuine differentiator.

**Key Gap:** Quantified investment returns from prior roles (especially Unicorn Factory Ventures) are not documented. For a $100M raise, this needs to be addressed.

The main opportunities to strengthen the deck are:

1. **Track record quantification** - Get Unicorn Factory Ventures IRR/MOIC, detail "$50M+ deployed" claim
2. **Risk management documentation** - Specifics for the 80% liquid strategy
3. **Narrative bridging** - Connect "Be long" tagline to platform commitment beyond fund
4. **Positioning clarity** - Address "Ventures" naming vs 80% liquid strategy

These are refinements, not fundamental concerns. Looking forward to discussing at the workshop.
