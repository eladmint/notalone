# NOTALONE Ventures LP Deck Analysis

**Document:** NOTALONE Ventures LP Deck (40 slides)
**Analysis Date:** December 24, 2024
**Analyst:** Multi-Agent Review (Strategic, Research, Ethical, Knowledge Architecture)

---

## Executive Summary

NOTALONE Ventures presents a **$100M hybrid digital asset fund** with a 3-year duration, 0% management fee, and a 20/80 split between pre-launch token investments and liquid/OTC trading strategies. The deck is well-designed and internally consistent, but raises significant questions about the appropriateness of the "Ventures" classification.

**Overall Assessment:** Transparent structure disclosure, but semantic mismatch between fund name and actual strategy.

---

## Slide-by-Slide Analysis

### Slide 1: Title
> "Be long, don't do investment alone - NOTALONE VENTURES"

**Comment:** The tagline "Be long" is interesting given the fund's short-cycle (3-year) structure. Traditional "long" positions in venture imply 7-10 year horizons. This creates an immediate tension between messaging and structure.

**Recommendation:** Consider whether "Be long" accurately represents the fund's actual time horizons.

---

### Slide 2: Market Context
> "Most 2021-2025 crypto funds are underwater"

**Comment:** Strong opening that establishes market pain point. This is accurate - many crypto funds deployed at peak valuations (2021-2022) and are underwater. Sets up the pitch for a differentiated approach.

**No issues identified.**

---

### Slide 3: Problem Framing
> "Is it just an unforgiving market?" / "Is it a mismatch in their DNA?"

**Comment:** Good rhetorical setup. Positions the problem as structural (fund design) rather than just market conditions. This frames NOTALONE's different structure as intentional, not compromised.

**No issues identified.**

---

### Slide 4: The Default Crypto VC Model

**Key Claims:**
- "Spray and pray" deployment optimizing for AUM
- Limited hands-on operating experience
- Driven by narrative segmentation
- Result: Median 1-year post-TGE performance is **-75%**

**Comment:** This slide effectively criticizes traditional crypto VC. The -75% median post-TGE stat is consistent with industry data (BeInCrypto, Binance listings analysis show similar figures).

**Question for NOTALONE:** What is NOTALONE's track record against this benchmark? The Case Studies (Slide 37) show 5x and 1.5x returns, but these are only 2 examples.

---

### Slide 5: The Game Has Changed
> "What worked in the last cycle no longer wins capital, attention, or returns."

**Comment:** Transition slide. Sets up the new playbook.

**No issues identified.**

---

### Slide 6: Playbook Comparison

| Last Cycle | This Cycle |
|------------|------------|
| Be early | Be selective |
| Be first | Be execution-driven |
| Back the narrative | Be globally connected |
| Wait for liquidity | **Plan for liquidity** |

**Comment:** "Plan for liquidity" is the key differentiator. This is honest about the fund's focus on exits/liquidity events rather than long-term holding. However, this further distinguishes the fund from traditional VC behavior.

**Observation:** This slide implicitly acknowledges the fund is optimizing for liquidity, not patient capital.

---

### Slide 7: Why Traditional Finance Frameworks Fail

**Key Points:**
- "Token launch is a standalone product"
- "Capital-only allocation no longer works"
- "Misaligned incentives remain unresolved"

**Comment:** Strong critique of passive capital allocation. The point about "limited GP skin in the game" sets up NOTALONE's 0% management fee as a differentiator.

**Question:** How does NOTALONE address the "misaligned incentives" they identify? What vesting terms do they negotiate with portfolio companies?

---

### Slide 8: The Right Tail Still Exists

**Key Claims:**
- ~10-15% of projects create the majority of value
- Well-structured setups still deliver **3x+ FDV expansion from seed to TGE**
- "Access has become structural"

**Comment:** The "seed to TGE" framing is notable. Traditional VC measures returns from seed to IPO/M&A (7-10 years). NOTALONE measures seed to TGE (typically 12-24 months). This is a fundamentally different return model.

**Implication:** Returns are being measured on a trading timeline, not a company-building timeline.

---

### Slides 9-13: Market Thesis

**Key Data Points:**
- $3.2T crypto market
- $310B+ stablecoin market cap (+57% YoY)
- $146B+ in crypto ETFs (+114% YoY)
- $120B+ DeFi TVL
- $18B+ tokenized RWAs (+300% YoY)

**Comment:** Standard crypto bull case. Data is accurate and well-sourced (DefiLlama, CMC, CoinGecko, rwa.xyz). The macro thesis (Fed policy stability driving crypto cycles) is a reasonable framework.

**No issues identified with the market thesis itself.**

---

### Slide 14-15: Crypto Market Cycles

**Key Claim:**
> "Following the Fed's balance sheet and rate regime change in December 2025, we expect a correction or accumulation phase lasting 8-12 months, concluding around July-October 2026... optimal investment window from Q3 2026 to Q4 2027, with exits expected by the end of 2029."

**Comment:** This is highly specific market timing. The fund is explicitly positioning as a **cycle-timed vehicle** rather than an evergreen strategy.

**Risk:** If the macro thesis is wrong, the entire fund strategy fails. This is a concentrated bet on cycle timing.

**Question:** What happens if the 2027-2028 expansion doesn't materialize as predicted? The 3-year structure + 2 one-year extensions provides some buffer, but this is still aggressive timing.

---

### Slides 16-19: Our Edge

**Key Claims:**
- "We're more than allocators"
- "Operators with hands-on experience scaling tech, tokens, and global distribution"
- 7+ years building Web3 products
- "We actively push selected projects from 'good' to the top 15% through execution"

**Comment:** This is the core value-add pitch. The team claims operational involvement, not just capital allocation. This is consistent with how top-tier VCs (a16z, Paradigm) differentiate themselves.

**Question:** What specific evidence supports the "push projects to top 15%" claim? The case studies show returns, but not execution support evidence.

---

### Slide 18: Why Our Deals Are Better

**Four Pillars:**
1. **Ecosystem Access** - Deep L1/L2 relationships for early visibility
2. **True Operating Partners** - "Running mates to projects"
3. **Direct Deal Flow** - First/second degree relationships only
4. **Trust** - "Actively protecting founders from misaligned deals"

**Comment:** The "Trust" point is notable - they claim to protect founders from misaligned deals. This is similar to a16z's positioning against predatory practices.

**Question:** What specific protections do they offer? What vesting terms do they require/accept? This is a critical gap in the deck.

---

### Slide 20: Due Diligence Framework

**Comment:** Comprehensive DD framework covering Idea, Team, Product, Growth, Exit, Fundraising, Competition, Culture, Execution, Web3-specific factors.

**Observation:** The "Exit" criteria include "Project roadmap and chosen fundraising strategy is in line with Fund's investment horizon" - this confirms they're filtering for projects that can exit within their 3-year window.

**Implication:** This structurally excludes longer-term infrastructure plays that may have better fundamentals but longer development timelines.

---

### Slide 21: Distribution Network

**Comment:** Impressive geographic reach (20+ countries). Shows operational capacity across US, UK, Germany, Israel, UAE, India, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, etc.

**No issues identified.**

---

### Slides 22-27: Fund Model

#### Slide 25: Fund Structure Highlights

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Fund Lifecycle | **3-year total duration** (vs. traditional 7-10 year) |
| Deployment | 18 months |
| Exit & Recycling | 18 months |
| Management Fee | **0%** |
| Carry | 20% |
| Redemptions | Semi-annual on undeployed capital |
| Operations | GP-funded |

**Comment:** The 0% management fee is genuinely LP-aligned and differentiates from typical 2% structures. The European waterfall (carry only after capital return) is also LP-friendly.

**However:** The 3-year duration is fundamentally incompatible with traditional venture capital. This is a hedge fund timeline, not a VC timeline.

---

#### Slide 26: Why a 3-Year Fund

**Key Quote:**
> "Traditional 7-10 year venture vehicles assume a stable, durable edge. In today's market structure, that assumption is weak."

**Comment:** This is the most intellectually honest statement in the deck. NOTALONE explicitly acknowledges they're NOT doing traditional VC because they believe the traditional model doesn't work in crypto.

**Problem:** If they acknowledge the traditional VC model doesn't work, why use "Ventures" in the name? This creates cognitive dissonance.

---

#### Slide 27: Unified Portfolio Architecture

| Bucket | Allocation | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Venture Select** | 20% ($20M) | "Long-duration asymmetric bets" with 2-3 year realization |
| **Liquid Alpha** | 80% ($80M) | "Short-cycle, post-launch opportunities" with ~12-month recycling |

**Key Claims:**
- "Reduces dependence on the venture J-curve"
- "Generates repeatable, cash-flow-like return cycles"
- "Preserves upside optionality without locking entire fund for 7-10 years"

**Comment:** The 80% Liquid Alpha is explicitly designed to generate "cash-flow-like return cycles" - this is hedge fund language, not VC language. The fund explicitly states it wants to avoid the J-curve (which is the defining characteristic of venture capital).

**Critical Observation:** The fund is designed to **NOT behave like a VC fund**. The "Ventures" name is semantically misleading.

---

### Slides 28-34: Investing Strategies

#### Slide 30: Pre-Launch (Venture) 20%

**Deals:**
- Pre-TGE **token/equity** allocations
- Pre-seed / Seed rounds
- Early private rounds with token/equity exposure

**Characteristics:**
- Illiquid
- **1-1.5 year realization**
- High variance, high upside
- ~5% target ownership

**Comment:** The mention of "token/equity" is notable - this suggests they may do SAFE + Token Warrant structures, not just SAFTs. However, the **1-1.5 year realization** window is still very short for "venture" investing.

**Question:** If realization is 1-1.5 years, what vesting terms are they accepting? This timeline suggests they're negotiating for short lockups.

---

#### Slide 31: Post-Launch (Liquid Alpha) 80%

**Instruments:**
- Post-launch OTC deals (locked discount)
- Liquid tokens (spot)
- Digital asset treasuries
- Loans / structured credit
- Market dislocation plays
- On-chain opportunities

**Characteristics:**
- All post-TGE
- **0.6-1 year capital recycling**
- "Zero dependence on narrative or multi-year lockups"

**Comment:** "Zero dependence on multi-year lockups" is explicitly anti-VC positioning. This is a liquid trading strategy.

---

#### Slide 32: Private Tokens Strategy (20%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Initial Check | $0.25-0.75M |
| Follow-on | $1-1.5M |
| Deals Count | ~20 initial + 5 follow-on |
| Target Ownership | ~5% |
| PMF Window | 18-36 months |

**Comment:** Check sizes are appropriate for pre-seed/seed. The 18-36 month PMF window is aggressive but not unreasonable for crypto.

---

#### Slide 33: OTC Strategy (80%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual Deals | ~20-40/year |
| Check Size | $1-5M |
| Discount Range | **30-50%** |
| Liquidity Horizon | **6-12 months** |
| Capital Recycling | ~1x per year |
| Target Return | **30-35% per cycle** |

**Comment:** This is pure OTC trading. Buying tokens at 30-50% discounts and exiting in 6-12 months is a trading strategy, not venture investing.

**Key Observation:** The fund's primary return driver (80% of capital) is OTC trading with 30-35% target returns per cycle. This is hedge fund activity.

---

#### Slide 34: Opportunistic Extensions

**Instruments:**
- Liquid tokens (spot)
- Digital asset treasuries
- Structured credit / loans
- On-chain opportunities

**Key Quote:**
> "Always short-cycle (~6-12 months)"
> "Zero dependence on narrative or multi-year lockups"

**Comment:** Reinforces the short-cycle, trading-focused nature of the majority of the portfolio.

---

### Slide 35: Summary of Terms

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Target Raise | $100 million |
| Organization | NOTALONE Ventures |
| Investment Period | 1.5 years + 1.5 years harvest + 2x1yr extensions |
| Recycling | No Private Token recycling; unlimited for other strategies |
| Management Fee | **0%** |
| Carry | 20% |
| Waterfall | **European** (carry after capital return) |
| Redemptions | Semi-annual, 30-day notice |

**Comment:** The terms are genuinely LP-friendly. 0% management fee and European waterfall are better than industry standard. However, the semi-annual redemptions on undeployed capital are more typical of hedge funds than VC.

---

### Slide 36-37: Case Studies

#### Investment 1: Venture Deal (Private Round)
- **Project:** Decentralized AI infra by web3-native team
- **Engagement:** Feb 2025
- **Value Added:** Product GTM + Token launch + MM + fundraising + tech development + Dev onboarding
- **Effect:** 100% liquidity in **4 months from TGE**
- **ROI:** **5x realized**, 50% still holding

#### Investment 2: Liquid Investment OTC
- **Project:** Top L1 project
- **Engagement:** June 2025
- **Value Added:** Closed a major government deal reaching millions of users
- **Deal:** 50% discount, 7-day TWAP, 25% release on day zero, **3.5 month vesting**
- **Effect:** 1.5x on investment, 2 more releases pending

**Comment on Investment 1:** "100% liquidity in 4 months from TGE" is the key phrase. This is NOT venture building - it's pre-TGE positioning for rapid exit. The 5x return is impressive, but the strategy is token speculation, not company building.

**Comment on Investment 2:** "3.5 month vesting" is extremely short. a16z advocates for 4-year vesting; NOTALONE is accepting 3.5 months. This is the kind of short vesting that a16z explicitly calls "predatory."

**Critical Question:** Does NOTALONE advocate for longer vesting terms, or do they accept whatever they can get? The case study suggests the latter.

---

### Slide 38-39: Team

**Team Members:**
1. **Ankit Raj** - Founder, General Partner (Core DAO ecosystem growth)
2. **Bandhul Bansal** - Founder, General Partner (ICP India Hub, 2x founder)
3. **Clement Chaikov** - Founder, General Partner (Former DFINITY Global Events/Community)
4. **David Shengart** - General Partner (Former GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, Founder/CEO of SWIDOM)
5. **Shashi Shekhar** - Founder, Managing Partner (Former Head of Global Adoption at DFINITY, Strategy Director at NEAR)
6. **Viktor Yelizarov** - Principal (Former Principal at Unicorn Factory Ventures, 8+ years Web3 experience)

**Comment:** Strong operational backgrounds in L1/L2 ecosystems (DFINITY, NEAR, Core DAO). Multiple team members with prior VC experience (Unicorn Factory Ventures). The team composition supports the "operators not allocators" claim.

**Question:** What is the track record of Unicorn Factory Ventures? How did their previous fund perform?

## Summary of Key Issues

### 1. Nomenclature Mismatch

| What They Call It | What It Actually Is |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Ventures" | Hybrid liquid token fund |
| "Venture Select" (20%) | Pre-TGE token allocation with 1-1.5yr exit |
| "Liquid Alpha" (80%) | OTC trading + market making |

**The "Ventures" name is semantically misleading.** The fund explicitly acknowledges it's not doing traditional VC (Slide 26) but still uses VC terminology.

---

### 2. Missing Information

The deck does NOT address:
- **Vesting policy:** What lockup terms do they negotiate/accept?
- **Regulatory structure:** Are they BVI-registered? ERA? RIA? This has significant implications for US investors.
- **Track record:** Only 2 case studies provided. What is the GP's historical performance?
- **Risk management:** How do they handle drawdowns? Position sizing? Stop losses?
- **LP composition:** Who are the target LPs? What are the minimums?

---

### 3. Structural Concerns

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **3-year duration** | Incompatible with traditional VC (7-10 years) |
| **80% liquid/trading** | This is hedge fund activity |
| **1-1.5 year realization** | Even "venture" bucket targets rapid exits |
| **Short vesting accepted** | Case study shows 3.5-month vesting (vs. a16z's 4-year standard) |
| **Cycle-dependent** | Entire strategy depends on 2026-2028 macro thesis |

---

### 4. Strengths

| Strength | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **0% management fee** | Genuinely LP-aligned |
| **European waterfall** | Carry only after capital return |
| **Transparent structure** | 20/80 split clearly disclosed |
| **Strong team** | Deep operational experience in L1/L2 ecosystems |
| **Honest framing** | Explicitly says traditional VC doesn't work in crypto |
| **GP-funded operations** | No hidden expense pass-throughs |

---

## Recommendations

### For NOTALONE

1. **Consider rebranding** from "Ventures" to "Capital" or "Digital Assets" to avoid semantic confusion

2. **Publish vesting standards** - If you want VC credibility, commit to a16z-style 4-year lockups

3. **Clarify regulatory structure** - Are you ERA, RIA, or offshore-only? This affects US LP access

4. **Provide more track record** - 2 case studies is insufficient. Show GP's historical performance

5. **Address the "dump" narrative** - How do you differentiate from predatory "mercenary capital"?

### For LPs Evaluating This Fund

1. **Understand what you're buying** - This is a hybrid liquid token fund, not traditional VC

2. **Verify regulatory status** - Confirm the fund's structure for your jurisdiction

3. **Assess cycle risk** - The strategy depends on 2026-2028 macro thesis being correct

4. **Evaluate team track record** - Request detailed historical performance from GP team

5. **Compare to alternatives** - Consider if a pure liquid fund or pure VC would better fit your portfolio

---

## Conclusion

NOTALONE Ventures presents a **coherent investment thesis** with **LP-friendly economics** (0% management fee, European waterfall). The team has genuine operational experience in the Web3 ecosystem.

However, the **"Ventures" classification is problematic**. By the fund's own admission (Slide 26), they are explicitly NOT doing traditional venture capital. The 3-year duration, 80% liquid allocation, and short exit timelines align more closely with a **liquid token hedge fund** than a venture capital fund.

**The core tension:** NOTALONE wants the credibility and deal flow access that comes with "VC" positioning, while operating a structure that is fundamentally different from VC.

**Is this fraud?** No - the deck is transparent about the structure.

**Is this misleading?** Potentially - depending on LP sophistication and expectations.

**Is this common?** Yes - many crypto funds use similar hybrid structures with "Ventures" branding.

**Should it be different?** That's a question for the industry to answer.
