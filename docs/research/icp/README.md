# ICP Growth Activities Research - Evidence-Based

**Status:** Active Research (Evidence-First Approach)
**Standard:** Every claim must have primary source URL
**Started:** November 30, 2025
**Updated:** December 28, 2025 - Added Chain Fusion Houses research track

## 🎯 Research Focus

Investigating ICP ecosystem growth activities to inform NotAlone's investment strategy:
- What growth tactics do successful ICP projects use?
- What are the documented results (with sources)?
- What are the actual costs and ROI (verifiable data only)?

**NEW (Dec 2025): Chain Fusion Houses as Growth Assets**
- Can the ICP Hubs Network event model serve as **Growth Assets** - infrastructure that provides predictable, measurable distribution?
- How does this solve the Investment Memo's core gap (events = "use sparingly" due to unverifiable ROI)?
- Chain Fusion Houses provides **17,268 verified signups, 24 organizers, 1.7M+ social reach** = measurable distribution
- What partnership and service delivery opportunities exist?
- How can this model be expanded to other ecosystems (Solana houses, ETH houses, etc.)?

## ✅ Verified So Far (With Sources)

### Strong Investment Candidates (4 projects)

**DSCVR (Social Network)**
- ✅ $9M Polychain funding (July 2022)
- ✅ 76K → 500K monthly uniques (Nov 2023 → Mar 2024)
- ⚠️ "Millions in NFT rewards" (quote verified, exact amount NOT disclosed)

**OpenChat (Messaging dApp)**
- ✅ $5.5M SNS raise (March 2023, <5 hours)
- ✅ 2,375 participants, 25M CHAT tokens
- ✅ ~90K users (third-party estimate)

**Sonic (DEX)**
- ✅ 88x volume growth ($10M → $880M+ monthly volume)
- ✅ Major ICP DEX with strong traction

**ICPSwap (DEX)**
- ✅ $6.7M SNS raise
- ✅ $9.47M TVL (established position)

### Mixed Signals (3 projects)

**KongSwap (DEX)** - New launch Oct 2024, $2M SNS, good capital efficiency
**Modclub (Infrastructure)** - 200+ dev interest, but no public usage metrics
**Distrikt (Social)** - Early 2021 launch, unclear current status

### Red Flags (2 projects)

**Hot or Not** - 1M ICP raised but community concerns (May 2024)
**Yuku AI** - Community investigation thread, limited transparency

## ❌ What Old Research Got Wrong

**Fabricated CAC Calculations:**
- DSCVR: Claimed "$5-15 CAC" based on invented $2M-$10M assumptions ❌
- OpenChat: Claimed "$10-50 CAC" with no source ❌
- Events: Claimed "$2,500-$12,500 per user" with no ICP-specific examples ❌

**User Metrics:**
- OpenChat: Old research claimed "10K DAU" but current data shows ~90K users (9x difference) ⚠️

**Pattern:** ~70-80% of old research was unsourced or fabricated

## 🔍 Current Research Status

**Working incrementally, one project at a time to avoid system crashes**

**Completed:**
- [x] DSCVR verification
- [x] OpenChat verification
- [x] Sonic verification
- [x] ICPSwap verification
- [x] Hot or Not verification (with red flags)
- [x] Distrikt verification (limited current data)

## 📊 Research Methodology

**Phase 1: Primary Source Collection**
- Web searches for official announcements, press releases, blog posts
- ICP Forum deep dive for project/hub reports
- Dashboard data (IC Dashboard, on-chain metrics)
- Archive.org backups for all sources

**Phase 2: Verification**
- Every quantitative claim gets a source URL
- Confidence level assigned (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- If no source found after thorough search: Label "UNVERIFIED" or exclude

**Phase 3: Conservative Analysis**
- Only analyze data with HIGH/MEDIUM confidence
- Extrapolations clearly labeled with methodology disclosed
- Explicit "What We Don't Know" sections

## 🚫 Old Research Deleted

**~14 documents with unsourced claims removed from repository (November 30, 2025)**

**Why deleted:** Failed VC diligence standard
- ~70-80% of claims were unsourced or fabricated
- CAC calculations based on invented assumptions
- No primary source URLs for critical metrics
- User was right to be skeptical

**What was removed:**
- Master synthesis reports (based on unsourced data)
- 10 deep research reports (fabricated CAC figures)
- Chain Fusion House analysis (unverified assumptions)
- All synthesis documents referencing unsourced claims

**Starting fresh with evidence-first approach**

**UPDATE Dec 2025:** Chain Fusion Houses research reinstated with **first-party data** from Notalone Notion workspace (17,268 verified signups, 24 events, 22+ organizers). See [icp-hubs-network-research.md](./icp-hubs-network-research.md).
