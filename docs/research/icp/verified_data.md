### NFT Rewards Program (⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED)

**What We Know:**
- DSCVR distributed "**millions of dollars in NFT rewards to users**" (exact quote from July 2022 PR Newswire)
- Program was active at time of $9M raise (July 2022)
- Contributed to user growth and engagement

**What We DON'T Know:**
- ❌ Exact dollar amount of NFT rewards distributed
- ❌ Distribution over time (was it $2M? $5M? $10M?)
- ❌ Cost per user acquired (cannot calculate without specific spend)
- ❌ Breakdown of rewards program mechanics

**Status:** Quote verified, specifics NOT disclosed publicly

---

### User Acquisition CAC (❌ CANNOT CALCULATE)

**Problem:**
- NFT rewards spend: "Millions of dollars" but no specific amount
- User base: We know 100K at funding, 400K-700K later, but unclear attribution
- Cannot calculate reliable CAC without:
  1. Specific NFT rewards budget
  2. Attribution methodology (which users came from rewards vs organic?)
  3. Time periods for spend vs acquisition

**Old Research Claim:** "$5-15 per user CAC"
**Verification Status:** ❌ FABRICATED (based on invented $2M-$10M assumptions)
**Recommendation:** DO NOT use this figure for investment decisions

---

## Summary: What We Can vs Cannot Verify

### ✅ What We CAN Verify (With Primary Sources)

**Projects:**
- DSCVR: $9M funding, 76K → 500K user growth, NFT rewards program exists
- OpenChat: $5.5M SNS raise, ~90K users, community ownership model

**Events:**
- Token2049 Chain Fusion Hub: Happened (Sept 2024, Fullerton Hotel)
- ETHDenver ICP presence: $25K bounty, ICP Hubs Meetup confirmed

**Hubs:**
- Indonesia hub: 2,000+ developers trained, 30+ university partnerships
- Korea hub: Exists, runs activities, has partnerships

### ❌ What We CANNOT Verify (No Public Data)

**User Acquisition Costs:**
- No disclosed marketing budgets for DSCVR or OpenChat
- Cannot calculate CAC for any ICP project
- No attribution data (which users came from which channel)

**Event Economics:**
- No attendance numbers for ICP-specific events
- No disclosed event budgets (except $25K ETHDenver prize pool)
- Cannot calculate cost per attendee or event ROI

**Hub Economics:**
- No disclosed hub budgets or revenues
- No cost per developer trained

- No event sponsorship amounts

**Critical Insight:**
Old research contained specific CAC figures ($5-15, $10-50, $2,500-$12,500, etc.) that **cannot be verified with publicly available data**. These figures were either:
1. Based on private/internal DFINITY data we don't have access to, OR
2. Fabricated/estimated without disclosure

**Recommendation:** For NotAlone investment decisions, acknowledge these knowledge gaps explicitly rather than using unverified figures.

- ⚠️ Newer project = less track record

**Recommendation:**
- Watch for Q4 2024 / Q1 2025 feature rollout (staking, multi-chain pools, limit orders)

## Research Summary Update

**Projects Researched:** 9 total

**Strong Investment Candidates:**
1. ✅ DSCVR - Strong growth (76K→500K), $9M funding
2. ✅ OpenChat - $5.5M SNS, ~90K users
3. ✅ Sonic - 88x volume growth, major DEX

**Red Flags / Not Recommended:**
8. ❌ Hot or Not - 1M ICP raised but community concerns (May 2024)
9. ❌ Yuku AI - Community investigation, no disclosed metrics, limited transparency

**Pattern Continues (100% Consistent Across All 9 Projects):**
- Product metrics available for successful projects
- **Growth economics NEVER disclosed (9/9 projects = 100%)**
- Some projects show red flags (Hot or Not community concerns, Yuku investigation)
- Need current metrics to assess ongoing projects (Distrikt)
- Newer projects need track record validation (KongSwap)
- Infrastructure plays need usage verification (Modclub - no public client numbers)
- Transparency matters - projects with investigations should be avoided (Yuku)
