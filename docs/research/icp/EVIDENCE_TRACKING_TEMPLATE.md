# ICP Growth Activities - Evidence Tracking Database

**Research Start Date:** November 30, 2025
**Evidence Standard:** VC Diligence (every key claim must have primary source URL)
**Focus:** Growth activities (events, social media, hackathons, community, hubs)

---

## How This Works

**Every claim in our research MUST be logged here with:**
1. ✅ Primary source URL (ICP Forum, Twitter, blog, GitHub, dashboard)
2. ✅ Archive URL (archive.org backup for preservation)
3. ✅ Date of source
4. ✅ Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. ✅ Notes on context, limitations, verification method

**If we can't find a source, we DON'T make the claim.**

## SECTION 5: User Acquisition Cost (CAC) Benchmarks

4. **Attribution confidence** (how sure are we users came from this channel?)

### CAC Data Template

**Tactic:** [e.g., "Event sponsorship"]
**Project:** [Which project]
**Example:** [Specific event/campaign]

**Spend:** $X - Source: [URL]
**Users Acquired:** Y users - Source: [URL]

**Attribution Method:** [How we know users came from this channel]
**Confidence:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

**Primary Sources:**
1. [URL]

**Archive URL:** [archive.org]

## RESEARCH PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Primary Source Collection (2-3 days)

**Day 1-2: Web Research**
- ICP Forum deep dive (all project announcements, hub reports, event recaps)
- Twitter/X archive (DFINITY, projects, hubs, founders)
- Project blogs (Medium, official sites)
- Dashboards (IC Dashboard, IC Rocks, OpenChat analytics if public)
- Devpost (hackathons)
- YouTube (event recordings, founder interviews)

**Day 3: Data Entry**
- Log every found data point in this template
- Create archive.org backups
- Assign confidence levels
- Flag gaps requiring follow-up research

### Phase 2: Verification & Triangulation (1-2 days)

**Day 4-5: Cross-Verification**
- For critical claims: Find 2-3 independent sources
- For conflicting data: Document discrepancies
- For unsourced claims: Label as "UNVERIFIED - needs primary source"

### Phase 3: Analysis (1 day)

**Day 6: Pattern Analysis**
- Only analyze data with HIGH/MEDIUM confidence
- Calculate CAC ranges (show math, disclose assumptions)
- Identify what works vs what doesn't (based on verified data only)
- Acknowledge knowledge gaps explicitly

### Phase 4: Report Creation (1 day)

**Day 7: Write Verified Report**
- Every claim cites this evidence database
- Every URL is clickable and archived
- Extrapolations clearly labeled
- Conservative estimates only
- "What We Don't Know" section

---

## QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before marking any claim as "VERIFIED":

- [ ] Primary source URL is clickable and loads
- [ ] Archive.org backup created and URL recorded
- [ ] Date of source documented
- [ ] Author/publisher identified (project, DFINITY, hub, third-party)
- [ ] Context understood (is this self-reported? Third-party verified? On-chain?)
- [ ] Confidence level assigned based on source quality
- [ ] Limitations/caveats noted

**If ANY of these are missing: Status = ⚠️ PARTIAL or ❌ UNVERIFIED**

---

## CURRENT STATUS

**Evidence Database Status:** 🔴 TEMPLATE CREATED, POPULATION IN PROGRESS

**Next Actions:**
1. Launch web research for DSCVR, OpenChat, ICP events
2. Begin logging sources in this template
3. Daily progress updates
4. Target: 50-100 verified data points by end of Week 1
