## CRITICAL UNSOURCED CLAIMS (Lines 1-100)

### 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY - Investment-Critical Metrics

| Line | Claim | Status | Issue | Required Source |
|------|-------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 11 | "Events ($2,500-12,500 per user) are prohibitively expensive" | ❌ UNSOURCED | No methodology, no examples, no URL | Need: 3+ ICP projects with disclosed event spend + user acquisition data |
| 13 | "DSCVR's 526% growth came from 'millions of dollars' in NFT rewards" | ⚠️ PARTIALLY SOURCED | "Millions" in quotes suggests source, but no URL provided | Need: DSCVR blog post, press release, or interview URL |
| 16 | "Community-led growth (Discord/Telegram) - $0-50 CAC" | ❌ UNSOURCED | No examples, no methodology | Need: Projects with disclosed Discord growth costs |
| 17 | "Token/NFT incentives (DSCVR model) - $50-200 CAC" | 🔢 EXTRAPOLATION | Calculated but based on unsourced "millions" claim | Need: Verify DSCVR's actual NFT spend first |
| 21 | "Web3 social apps see Day 30 retention of only 3-10% (vs 42% for Web2)" | ❌ UNSOURCED | Industry benchmark applied without ICP validation | Need: ICP-specific retention data or citation of benchmark source |
| 28 | "526% in 3 months (Nov 2023 → Feb 2024: 76K → 400K monthly uniques)" | ❌ UNSOURCED | Specific numbers without source | Need: DSCVR dashboard URL, press release, or verified tweet |
| 29 | "700K+ (Oct 2024), 1M+ monthly uniques (Sep 2024)" | ❌ UNSOURCED | No source for these metrics | Need: DSCVR official announcement or dashboard data |
| 30 | "$9M from Polychain Capital (July 2022)" | ❌ UNSOURCED | Funding amount without source | Need: Crunchbase, press release, or Polychain announcement |
| 36 | "Millions of dollars in NFT rewards to users (exact amount not disclosed)" | ❌ UNSOURCED | Critical metric for CAC calculation, unsourced | Need: DSCVR tokenomics post, founder interview, or blog |
| 47-54 | Conservative/Mid/Upper CAC estimates ($2.86-$14.29) | 🔢 FABRICATED | Calculations based on invented "$2M-$10M" assumptions | ❌ ENTIRE ANALYSIS INVALID without source for NFT spend |

## ANALYSIS OF FABRICATION PATTERN

### The "$2,500-$12,500 Event CAC" Claim

**Where it appears:** Line 11, Line 19, Executive Summary
**Problem:** This is the CORE claim of the report (events are expensive, avoid them)
**Evidence provided:** ZERO primary sources

**What we need:**
```
Project A: [URL to project blog/tweet]
- Event: ETHDenver 2024
- Spend: $50,000 (booth + staff + travel)
- Users acquired: 20 (tracked via referral codes)
- CAC: $2,500/user
- Source: [Direct link to project's post-mortem or disclosure]

Project B: [URL]
- Event: Token2049 Singapore 2024
- Spend: $100,000
- Users acquired: 8
- CAC: $12,500/user
- Source: [Direct link]
```

**What we have:** Nothing. Just the claim.

### The DSCVR NFT Rewards Calculation

**Line 47-54 shows this logic:**
```
"Conservative Estimate" (assuming $2M in NFT rewards):
- $2M distributed ÷ 700K users = $2.86 per user

"Mid-Range Estimate" (assuming $5M in NFT rewards):
- $5M distributed ÷ 700K users = $7.14 per user

"Upper Estimate" (assuming $10M in NFT rewards):
- $10M distributed ÷ 700K users = $14.29 per user
```

**Problem:** The ENTIRE calculation is based on **INVENTED ASSUMPTIONS**

- Where did "$2M-$10M" come from? NO SOURCE
- Where did "700K users" come from? NO SOURCE
- The report acknowledges: "exact amount not disclosed" (Line 36)
- Then PROCEEDS TO INVENT three estimates and calculate CAC from them

**This is exactly what the user is concerned about: fabricated data presented as analysis.**

---

### The "Millions of Dollars" Quote

**Line 13, 36:** Claims DSCVR distributed "millions of dollars in NFT rewards"

**This is in quotes, suggesting it came from somewhere, but:**
- No URL provided
- No attribution (who said this? DSCVR founder? Press release? Blog?)
- No verification

**Required:**
- Find the original source of this quote
- If it doesn't exist, this is a fabricated claim and must be retracted

---

## PRELIMINARY AUDIT VERDICT (First 100 Lines)

**Status:** ❌ FAILS VC DILIGENCE STANDARD

**Reasons:**
1. Core investment thesis ("avoid events, use community-led growth") based on unsourced CAC claims
2. DSCVR case study uses fabricated assumptions ($2M-$10M NFT spend) to calculate CAC
3. No primary source URLs for any quantitative metrics
4. Critical claims (526% growth, $9M raise, 700K users) presented as facts without verification

**Estimated % of Claims That Are Unsourced/Fabricated:** 70-80%

**Confidence in Report's Conclusions:** LOW

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Verify or Retract Core Claims

**Priority 1:** Event CAC ($2,500-$12,500)
- [ ] Find 3+ ICP projects with disclosed event spend + user acquisition
- [ ] If not found: RETRACT claim or label as "ESTIMATED, UNVERIFIED"

**Priority 2:** DSCVR NFT Rewards
- [ ] Find source for "millions of dollars" quote (search DSCVR blog, press releases, founder interviews)
- [ ] If found: Get exact amount or range
- [ ] If not found: RETRACT entire CAC calculation (Lines 47-54)

**Priority 3:** DSCVR Growth Metrics
- [ ] Find source for 76K → 400K → 700K → 1M growth trajectory
- [ ] Check DSCVR dashboard, Twitter, press releases
- [ ] Archive URLs for verification

**Priority 4:** DSCVR Funding
- [ ] Verify $9M Polychain raise (check Crunchbase, press releases)
- [ ] Get date and terms if possible

### 2. Launch Primary Source Research

**Web Search Strategy:**
```
1. "DSCVR 526% growth" OR "DSCVR 400K users"
2. "DSCVR NFT rewards millions" OR "DSCVR airdrop"
3. "DSCVR Polychain $9M" OR "DSCVR funding"
4. site:dscvr.one/blog OR site:medium.com/@dscvr
5. site:twitter.com (from:@dscvr_one OR from:@dscvr)
```

**Expected Timeline:** 2-4 hours to verify or debunk DSCVR claims

### 3. Create Evidence Tracking Spreadsheet

**Columns:**
- Claim
- Current Source Status (Verified / Partially Sourced / Unsourced / Fabricated)
- Primary Source URL (if found)
- Archive URL
- Confidence Level
- Action Taken (Verified / Retracted / Relabeled as Estimate)

---

## RECOMMENDATION TO USER

**Do NOT use Report 07 for investment decisions until verified.**

**Options:**
1. **Pause investments** until rigorous research completed (4-6 days)
2. **Use only verified claims** from existing research (will dramatically reduce available data)
3. **Conduct your own primary research** independent of these reports

**My assessment:** The user was RIGHT to be skeptical. This research does not meet VC diligence standards and contains fabricated data masquerading as analysis.

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Continue auditing Report 07 (Lines 101-1709)
2. Launch web search for DSCVR primary sources
3. Create evidence tracking spreadsheet

**Tomorrow:**
4. Audit remaining high-priority reports (Master Synthesis, Chain Fusion House)
5. Begin primary source collection for growth activities
6. Share audit results with user

**This Week:**
7. Complete verified research report (only sourced claims)
8. Flag all unsourced/fabricated claims for retraction
9. Conduct gap-filling research with strict citation requirements
