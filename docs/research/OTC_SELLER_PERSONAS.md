**Document Type:** Strategic Research & Market Intelligence
**Created:** 2025-12-28
**Status:** Active

---

## Executive Summary

This document profiles four distinct personas of post-TGE crypto projects that seek OTC deals (selling tokens at a discount). These represent NOTALONE's primary target "portfolio companies" for its Liquid Fund (80% of capital allocation).

**Key Market Context:**
- OTC trading volumes surged 95-106% YoY in 2024, driven by institutional demand and regulatory clarity
- Many top 20 tokens trade at nearly 50% discount with 1-year lock-up on secondary OTC markets
- Projects outside top 100 trade at discounts as steep as 70%
- Typical OTC terms: 30-50% discount, 1-3 year vesting, 6-12 month cliff

## Persona 1: "The Growth-Starved"

### Archetype Summary
*Solid technology, strong fundamentals, but struggling with adoption and ecosystem traction*

---

### 1. Company Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stage** | Post-TGE, 6-18 months since launch |
| **Token Status** | Listed on 2-3 CEXs (likely Tier-2: Gate, KuCoin, MEXC), some DEX liquidity; moderate volume ($500K-$5M daily) |
| **Token Performance** | Down 40-70% from ATH; currently in "just growth" or "accumulation" phase |
| **Treasury Situation** | 30-50% of treasury in native token, limited stablecoin runway (6-12 months); selling OTC to fund growth initiatives |
| **Team Composition** | 10-25 FTEs; strong technical team (5-10 developers); weak or non-existent growth/BD team; possibly 1-2 advisors |
| **Geographic Focus** | Typically single-region origin (Asia, Europe, or Americas); limited international presence |

### 2. Pain Points / Why They Need OTC

| Pain Point | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Adoption Stagnation** | Product works, but DAU/MAU flat or declining; "build it and they will come" strategy failed | CRITICAL |
| **Developer Ecosystem Gap** | Few or no third-party integrations; hackathons produced limited lasting projects | HIGH |
| **Marketing Vacuum** | Technical founders uncomfortable with marketing; existing efforts (Twitter, Discord) show minimal engagement | HIGH |
| **Token Price Pressure** | Fear that selling on market will crash price further; need capital without market impact | MEDIUM |
| **Partnership Drought** | Cold outreach to potential partners fails; no warm introductions to key ecosystems | MEDIUM |
| **Grant Dependency** | Previously survived on ecosystem grants; grants drying up as ecosystems tighten budgets | MEDIUM |

**Root Cause:** Technical founders built excellent product but underestimated go-to-market complexity. Token without genuine utility tends to lose value quickly, relying solely on hype and speculation.

### 3. What They're Looking For in an OTC Buyer

| Requirement | Priority | Details |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Strategic Value-Add** | MUST HAVE | Not just capital - need ecosystem access, developer network, marketing support |
| **Growth Expertise** | MUST HAVE | GTM execution experience in Web3; help defining and reaching target users |
| **Developer Network** | HIGH | Access to builders who can create integrations, tooling, complementary dApps |
| **Marketing Support** | HIGH | Content strategy, KOL relationships, community building expertise |
| **Reasonable Terms** | MEDIUM | Willing to offer 30-40% discount with 12-18 month vesting if value-add is genuine |
| **Non-Predatory Behavior** | MUST HAVE | Won't dump on first unlock; aligned long-term incentives |

**Deal Terms Sensitivity:**
- Discount: 25-40% (will go higher for strategic buyers)
- Vesting: 12-24 months acceptable
- Cliff: 6-12 months acceptable
- Minimum Check: $100K-$500K
- Will offer advisory tokens for exceptional value-add

### 4. NOTALONE Value Proposition Match

| NOTALONE Capability | Match to Need | Value Creation |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **30K Developers Network** | PERFECT | Access to builder community for integrations, hackathons, ecosystem growth |
| **650+ Projects Portfolio** | STRONG | Cross-portfolio collaboration, integration opportunities, shared learnings |
| **GTM Execution (notalone.services)** | PERFECT | End-to-end growth support: marketing, BD, partnerships, listings |
| **20+ Country Ambassador Network** | STRONG | Regional market penetration, local community building, event presence |
| **100+ Service Providers** | STRONG | Vetted specialists for specific needs (KOLs, PR, dev tools, audits) |
| **MM Relationships** | MEDIUM | Liquidity support for exchange listings |
| **Milestone-Based Structure** | STRONG | Aligned incentives - NOTALONE succeeds only when they grow |

**Competitive Advantage:** Unlike pure financial buyers who hedge and extract value, NOTALONE provides embedded operational support that directly addresses the growth gap.

## Persona 2: "The Liquidity-Challenged"

### Archetype Summary
*Functional project with operational costs exceeding token-denominated treasury's real value*

---

### 1. Company Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stage** | Post-TGE, 12-36 months since launch |
| **Token Status** | Listed on 1-3 exchanges; declining volume ($100K-$2M daily); thin order books |
| **Token Performance** | Down 70-90% from ATH; may be in bear market or extended "just growth" phase |
| **Treasury Situation** | 60-80% in native token (essentially illiquid); stablecoin runway: 3-6 months; urgent need for operational capital |
| **Team Composition** | Reduced from peak (layoffs occurred); 5-15 FTEs; skeleton crew maintaining product; senior departures |
| **Geographic Focus** | Often remote-first; may have reduced physical presence |

### 2. Pain Points / Why They Need OTC

| Pain Point | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Cash Runway Crisis** | Stables running out; can't pay salaries, infrastructure, legal costs beyond 3-6 months | CRITICAL |
| **Treasury Trap** | Selling native token on market would crash price and trigger panic | CRITICAL |
| **Token Price Death Spiral** | Previous unlocks sold on market created downward pressure; market views as "dump token" | HIGH |
| **Team Retention** | Key developers considering leaving; token comp now worthless | HIGH |
| **Regulatory Compliance Costs** | Legal fees mounting; can't afford ongoing compliance work | MEDIUM |
| **Infrastructure Costs** | Cloud costs, node operations, audits still running; can't cut without killing product | MEDIUM |

**Root Cause:** Token treasuries mostly in native tokens create significant risks. Any significant sale forces price down, sparking panic selling and potential collapse. Projects need 20%+ in liquid assets during market stress, but most keep only 5%.

### 3. What They're Looking For in an OTC Buyer

| Requirement | Priority | Details |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Immediate Capital** | CRITICAL | Need stablecoins within 30 days for operational survival |
| **No Public Market Impact** | MUST HAVE | OTC buyer who will absorb tokens without selling pressure |
| **Flexible Deal Structure** | HIGH | May offer deeper discounts for faster capital access |
| **Extended Partnership** | MEDIUM | Someone who can help rebuild, not just provide exit liquidity |
| **Non-Disclosure** | HIGH | Don't want market to know they're selling at distressed prices |
| **Potential Follow-On** | MEDIUM | May need additional capital in 6-12 months |

**Deal Terms Sensitivity:**
- Discount: 50-70% (desperate for capital)
- Vesting: 6-18 months (prefer shorter to close faster)
- Cliff: 3-6 months (can negotiate)
- Minimum Check: $50K-$250K (will take smaller checks for speed)
- May offer team tokens in addition to treasury tokens

### 4. NOTALONE Value Proposition Match

| NOTALONE Capability | Match to Need | Value Creation |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Liquid Fund Capital** | PERFECT | Immediate stablecoin capital for operations |
| **Discrete OTC Process** | STRONG | Private negotiations, no market signal |
| **50%+ Discount Target** | PERFECT | NOTALONE's investment criteria aligns with their offering |
| **Short Vesting Preference** | STRONG | NOTALONE prefers 6-9 month full unlock |
| **Network of Service Providers** | MEDIUM | Can reduce costs by connecting to vetted providers |
| **Potential Revival Support** | MEDIUM | If fundamentals warrant, NOTALONE can help rebuild |
| **Portfolio Effects** | MEDIUM | May benefit from integration with other portfolio companies |

**Competitive Advantage:** NOTALONE can move fast (decision within weeks, not months), provides capital without the extractive terms of distressed debt, and brings operational expertise if the project warrants revival.

**Risk Consideration:** These deals carry higher risk but also offer the deepest discounts (50-70%). NOTALONE's hedging strategy (VWAP-based) is essential for capital protection.

## Persona 3: "The Strategic Upgrader"

### Archetype Summary
*Successful project seeking premium partners to reach the next level of scale*

---

### 1. Company Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stage** | Post-TGE, 12-24 months since launch; product-market fit achieved |
| **Token Status** | Listed on 3-5 CEXs including at least one Tier-1 (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken); healthy liquidity ($5M-$50M daily volume) |
| **Token Performance** | Down 20-50% from ATH but stable; in "accumulation above" or "just growth" phase |
| **Treasury Situation** | Well-managed; 40-60% in stables/ETH; selling OTC strategically to onboard value-add partners, not out of desperation |
| **Team Composition** | 25-50+ FTEs; professional management; may have COO/CFO; existing growth team but seeking acceleration |
| **Geographic Focus** | Multi-region presence; looking to expand into new markets (often Asia<>Americas or Europe expansion) |

### 2. Pain Points / Why They Need OTC

| Pain Point | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Cap Table Quality** | Existing investors are passive; want active partners with operational value | HIGH |
| **Enterprise Access Gap** | Want to land major enterprise deals but lack connections | HIGH |
| **Geographic Expansion** | Strong in home region but need local partners for international growth | HIGH |
| **Regulatory Navigation** | Entering regulated markets (US, EU) requires sophisticated legal/compliance partners | MEDIUM |
| **Market Maker Relationships** | Current MM arrangements adequate but seeking tier-1 relationships | MEDIUM |
| **Brand Elevation** | Want association with premium ecosystem players, not just financial investors | MEDIUM |

**Root Cause:** Not a "problem" per se - this is strategic capital raising. They're optimizing their partner network, not solving a crisis. Seeking investors who provide strategic capital: marketing support, tokenomics advisory, and network access that smaller retail investors cannot provide.

**Deal Terms Sensitivity:**

- Minimum Check: $500K-$2M (want meaningful partnership, not small retail)
- May offer advisory/board positions for exceptional partners

### 4. NOTALONE Value Proposition Match

| **650+ Portfolio Ecosystem** | STRONG | Strategic integration opportunities across portfolio |

## Persona 4: "The Pivot Seeker"

### Archetype Summary
*Project needing ecosystem expansion, cross-chain deployment, or narrative pivot*

---

### 1. Company Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stage** | Post-TGE, 18-48 months since launch; often "legacy" in crypto terms |
| **Token Status** | Listed on multiple exchanges but may be losing relevance; volume declining; community fragmented |

| **Treasury Situation** | Variable; may have significant treasury but facing strategic crossroads about how to deploy |
| **Team Composition** | 15-40 FTEs; may be experiencing leadership transition; new strategic hires in growth/BD roles |
| **Geographic Focus** | Often concentrated in one ecosystem (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) seeking multi-chain expansion |

### 2. Pain Points / Why They Need OTC

| Pain Point | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Single-Chain Limitation** | Built on one chain; users on other chains can't access; liquidity fragmented | CRITICAL |
| **Narrative Obsolescence** | Original thesis (e.g., "DeFi 2.0", "NFT utility") no longer resonates; need new positioning | HIGH |
| **Ecosystem Decline** | Home ecosystem losing developers/users to competitors | HIGH |
| **Technology Debt** | Architecture needs modernization for cross-chain world | MEDIUM |
| **Community Fatigue** | Long-term holders frustrated with lack of progress; need fresh narrative | MEDIUM |

**Root Cause:** The blockchain landscape has evolved. Single-chain projects face fragmented liquidity, decreased capital efficiency, and loss of composability benefits. Multi-chain strategies are now essential for scalability and user experience.
