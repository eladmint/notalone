Trump—who vowed to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world—was elected alongside the most pro-crypto Congress in history. ETFs were approved, giving crypto its official kosher stamp from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other financial giants.Foundational regulations were introduced, paving the way for further adoption, while top-tier financial institutions—from Swift to UBS—began building on-chain solutions. The infrastructure powering our industry took a massive leap forward, enabling consumer apps like Polymarket to achieve mass adoption worldwide—even among non-crypto users.At its core, crypto is built on cryptography and cybersecurity—fields where Israel excels. Israeli entrepreneurs, including veterans of elite intelligence and special forces units who helped build the last generation of the internet, are now poised to build the financial rails the world will rely on in the years ahead.The events following October 7th put Israel's resilience and entrepreneurial spirit on full display, reinforcing the country's position as a global technology leader.We founded Collider as Israel's first fund dedicated to crypto, and we are committed to making Israel the second-largest crypto hub in the world. We created this report to help you see what we see—a glimpse into the future of the Israeli crypto ecosystem and the industry as a whole. From stablecoins and real-world assets to decentralized AI and DePIN, the landscape is evolving fast.As Israelis, we believe in radical transparency, brutal honesty, and directness. Capital is fungible—every VC can be replaced. But what makes us different is the Israeli spirit. We back the hustlers, the ones with chutzpah, those who shake the status quo.Crypto is a Quantum LeapThe history of money reflects society's technological evolution. While primitive economies relied on barter and physical exchange of precious metals, goods and services, the introduction of paper currency by central banks marked the first major innovation in monetary systems.Just as electronic payments transformed commerce in the late 20th century, blockchain technology is now reshaping financial infrastructure. This shift is not only technological. It represents a fundamental change in how value moves through the global economy. Today, we're witnessing another fundamental shift as the financial infrastructure moves toward digital money that's powered by blockchain technology.Recent developments suggest this transformation is accelerating. In 2024, we saw transaction volumes on blockchain networks exceed $14 trillion, surpassing Visa's annual payment volume. Major financial institutions are actively integrating this technology: SWIFT began testing blockchain settlement for its $150 trillion annual transaction network, while BlackRock launched its first tokenized investment fund.2024 marked a decisive shift in this evolution, characterized by three key developments:1. Infrastructure MaturityTransaction costs on major networks have decreased by 95% through technological improvements and scalability solutions, while settlement times have reduced to near-instant. These advances not only make blockchain-based systems competitive with traditional financial rails for the first time, but in some cases superior.2. Positive Regulatory ClarityThe regulatory landscape has evolved significantly. Over 300 lawmakers with clear positions on digital asset policy now hold congressional seats, and the newly elected president, Donald J. Trump, has pledged to make the US "Crypto's capital on the planet". Not only has this political shift enabled traditional financial institutions to engage more confidently with blockchain technology, it also seems to encourage greater appetite to deploy capital into crypto markets.3. Institutional AccessThe approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs marked a watershed moment, attracting over $130 billion in institutional capital within months. Traditional custodians like BNY Mellon and State Street have established digital asset services, while investment banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have expanded their trading operations.The Market EvolutionThe rapid institutional adoption reflects broader market maturation. In less than a decade, the industry has seen remarkable growth: 500 million people globally now hold digital assets, while major financial firms have made strategic moves into the space. PayPal launched its own digital dollar (stablecoin), Stripe made a $1 billion acquisition of settlement infrastructure, and Visa introduced its own asset tokenization platform.Looking ForwardThe implications of this technology extend well beyond traditional finance. This report examines how blockchain infrastructure is transforming multiple sectors: prediction markets are emerging as sophisticated forecasting tools for financial and economic indicators; social platforms are evolving into programmable networks with native payment systems; new models for building and operating physical infrastructure are emerging, from distributed computing networks to wireless communications systems. Digital ownership and privacy solutions, powered by advanced cryptography, are creating new possibilities for secure, compliant transactions. Each of these developments represents distinct market opportunities, which we will explore in detail throughout this report.2024: Was Crypto's Greatest YearThe on-chain economy is showing extraordinarily rapid growth, with its market penetration speed already surpassing that of other major technological disruptions (Graph comparing user base growth of Crypto, Internet, and Mobile Phone).Crypto Got Its Kosher Seal - January 2024: ETFs were approved, and crypto received a seal of quality from the world's largest financial institutions—including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and others.Institutions Are No Longer Coming—They Are Here: March 2024: Major financial institutions launched their own crypto products—from BlackRock launching its own tokenized fund, to Stripe acquiring the largest stablecoin infrastructure, to Swift's blockchain pilot with UBS."The U.S. Will Be the Crypto Capital of the Planet"— July - Nov 2024: Trump's election promise, nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers will take seats in Congress July 2024 (the promise) and November 2024 (Trump won, congress changed).The Infrastructure Is Also Here - March 2024: Transaction costs on-chain decreased dramatically, with multiple L2s seeing over 95% cost reductions. There has been a major increase in the number of consumer apps as infrastructure became ripe.Stablecoins Internet-Native Money - December 2024: Stablecoins achieved clear product-market fit, surpassing $200 billion in market cap.First-of-Its-Kind Crypto Consumer App - November 2024: Polymarket reached $2.5 billion in monthly trading volume, outranking Tik Tok, Instagram, and ChatGPT on the App Store.2024 Bull Market: - September 2024: The total crypto market cap increased 2x. BTC increased 115%, while ETH increased 42%.Crypto ETFs Have Torn Down the Walls That Kept Institutions OutThe 2004 launch of the first gold ETF transformed how institutional investors accessed the precious metals market. By eliminating the operational complexity of physical custody, the gold ETF opened the asset class to broader institutional participation and revolutionized portfolio allocation strategies.Digital assets are experiencing a similar institutional transformation. The January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by Ethereum ETFs in July, has created regulated, accessible vehicles for institutional exposure.The market response has been unprecedented: Bitcoin ETFs attracted $36.2 billion in net inflows through December 2024, with first-day trading volumes exceeding $5 billion. Two digital asset ETFs now rank among the top 10 ETFs by assets under management across all categories launched in the past decade.This remarkable adoption and market appetite is particularly evident in the data. Bitcoin ETFs accounted for up to 8.4% of total U.S. ETF trading volume in their early months, with average daily volume reaching 68 million shares. By December 2024, Bitcoin ETFs had accumulated over $130 billion in assets under management, surpassing the total AUM of U.S. gold ETFs—a remarkable, almost inconceivable achievement for a new asset class. Ethereum ETFs, while launching later in the year, have shown similar momentum: first-day trading exceeded $1 billion, with December 2024 seeing record weekly inflows of $855 million.These vehicles are backed by premier asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, providing the operational infrastructure and risk management frameworks institutional investors require. The products offer several key advantages:Simplified Custody: Institutions can gain exposure without the immense security burden that is managing private keys and digital wallets.Regulatory Clarity: ETFs operate within established and fully regulated securities frameworks.Market Access: Standard creation/redemption mechanisms align with institutional workflow standards.The momentum of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has catalyzed broader market development. Several firms have filed applications for ETFs tracking other digital assets, including Solana and XRP. The Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), if passed, could accelerate this expansion by classifying various digital assets as commodities.This could enable more diverse product offerings, such as cryptocurrency index funds or sector-specific ETFs focusing on particular segments of the digital asset market. The success of these initial products heavily implies we're entering a new phase of institutional digital asset adoption. As the ETF ecosystem matures, we expect to see the development of more sophisticated products, including yield-enhanced vehicles and multi-asset strategies. Calamos' announcement of downside-protected Bitcoin ETFs for 2025 indicates continued innovation in meeting diverse institutional needs.Institutions are comingThe institutional adoption of digital assets has long been constrained by operational and regulatory barriers. While select pioneers like MicroStrategy, Tesla and even the country of El Salvador navigated these challenges to establish positions in Bitcoin, the broader institutional market remained largely sidelined by custody complexities, regulatory uncertainty, and risk management challenges. Put simply - our industry was not ready.The current institutional landscape marks a decisive shift from this early period. Major financial institutions are now developing comprehensive digital asset strategies:BlackRock, beyond its ETF offerings, has integrated digital assets into its Aladdin platform, used by over 55,000 investment professionals.BNY Mellon, the world's largest custodian bank, now provides digital asset custody services to institutional clients.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have established dedicated digital asset trading desks.Fidelity offers institutional custody solutions alongside its retail and ETF products.This institutional integration extends beyond traditional financial services. Fortune 500 companies are exploring digital asset treasury strategies, while sovereign entities are developing frameworks for digital asset reserves. President Trump has formally created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile by executive order. The trend reflects growing recognition of digital assets as a distinct asset class requiring dedicated infrastructure and expertise.The institutional ecosystem continues to mature through several key developments:Mature Custody Solutions: Expansion of regulated custody services from traditional financial institutions.Trading Infrastructure: Development of institutional-grade trading platforms and prime services.Risk Management: Introduction of sophisticated and liquid hedging instruments as well as portfolio and risk management tools.Compliance Frameworks: Evolution of institutional-grade compliance, security and reporting solutions.These improvements in market infrastructure are enabling more sophisticated institutional participation. For example, the emergence of regulated derivatives markets has improved price discovery and risk management capabilities, while enhanced custody solutions have reduced operational barriers to entry.Looking ahead, the institutional ecosystem will continue to evolve. The emergence of potential yield-generating products, including institutional-grade staking vehicles, will create new opportunities for capital allocation and portfolio diversification. Meanwhile, the deepening integration of these financial products with traditional financial systems is enabling sophisticated investment strategies and broader financial products around digital assets. Not only that, but on-chain integrations are also happening, in an attempt to fully bridge the gap between traditional finance markets and digital blockchain-based markets. As the market continues to mature and product offerings expand, we fully expect to see acceleration in institutional adoption across an increasingly diverse range of digital asset opportunities.Onchain Holdings Bitcoin ETFs, in BitcoinOver 1 million BTC are being held by ETFs. (Graph showing BTC holdings by ETFs from Feb 2024 to Feb 2025: All, Franklin Templeto, 21Shares, Fidelity, Blackrock, Grayscale).DeFiThe traditional financial system, built over centuries, has served as the backbone of global commerce. However, there's no denying that its architecture, developed in an era of physical ledgers and manual processes, increasingly struggles to meet the demands of a digital economy in the digital age. While these systems are robust, they are often slow, involve multiple intermediaries, manual processes, and incur excessive fees and significant settlement times.The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) represents a technological evolution in financial markets and their underlying infrastructure. Through automation, programmable services and permissionless—meaning needing no approval to participate in any way—access, powered by blockchain technology and smart contracts, users can engage and interact with a myriad of financial systems and products from any place, at any time.This market has grown significantly, with total value locked in DeFi protocols reaching $140 billion by December 2024.DeFi Comparison TableFeatureTraditional Finance (TradFi)Decentralized Finance (DeFi)Trading InfrastructureRequires brokers & intermediaries, T+1 or T+2 settlement cycles, Limited operating hours, High intermediary feesDirect peer-to-peer trading, Instant settlement, 24/7 operations, Lower fees with no intermediariesLending & BorrowingExtensive documentation required, Manual underwriting process, Credit checks and KYC, Days/weeks for approval, Fixed termsAutomated lending, Instant loan execution, No credit checks needed, Flexible loan terms, Dynamic interest rates, Borrow large amounts for extremely short time periods (flash loans)Settlement1-3 day settlement period, Multiple intermediaries involved, Business hours only, High operational costsNear-instant settlement, Direct settlement between parties always operational, Lower operational costsMarket MakingDominated by large institutions, Hidden order books, High capital requirements, Limited access, Extremely competitiveOpen to all participants, Transparent liquidity pools, Lower capital requirements, Automated market making, Complex strategy support, Peer-to-peer (CLOBs) or Peer-to-poolPortfolio ManagementHigh management fees, Limited transparency, Restricted access, Manual rebalancingLower fees, Full transparency, Open access, Automated strategiesRisk ManagementCentralized risk assessment, Regulatory protection, FDIC insurance (where applicable), Established legal frameworksSmart contract risk, Protocol risk, Oracle risk, No FDIC insurance, Evolving regulatory frameworkAccess & ControlGeographic restrictions, Minimum investment requirements, Limited control over assets, KYC/AML requirementsGlobal access, No minimum requirements, Full asset control, Pseudonymous participation, Available 24/7Innovation SpeedSlow implementation of changes, Heavy regulatory oversight, Limited by legacy systems, Corporate bureaucracyRapid innovation, Community governance, Composable and interactive systems, Open-source development"The market infrastructure we've been operating on is 50 years old... What we're now seeing with blockchain technologies are tremendous improvements—cutting processing times, enabling real-time information, and supporting a $24\times7$ 365 trading environment... We're also beginning to consolidate assets into common holding structures called wallets, which is a huge improvement in itself."Sandy Kaull, Senior Vice President at Franklin TempletonIn 2024, DeFi saw major growth, driven by innovations like restaking (EigenLayer), fixed-yield products and real-world asset tokenization. Solana emerged as a key player, with its DeFi TVL surging from $1.4 billion to $12 billion, fueled by protocols like Jito, Raydium, Jupiter and Kamino. Solana's decentralized exchanges' volume hit $129 billion monthly, surpassing Ethereum's peak, driven by the retail memecoin frenzy. Institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs accelerated adoption, with Bitcoin ETFs amassing billions upon billions, and tokenization of assets like real estate and US Gov't T-bills expanding. Solana and Ethereum attracted firms like PayPal (PYUSD stablecoin) and Visa (USDC settlements), and the overall stablecoin market capitalization surpassed $205 Billion, marking 15 consecutive monthly increases.Every bit of the legacy financial systems will be, sooner or later, updated to fit the digital age we live in. The pace of innovation, even in Fintech, is not even close to the open-source nature of DeFi. And as such, DeFi protocols have quickly evolved far beyond simply replicating traditional financial services. New financial primitives are emerging that weren't possible in traditional systems:Fixed Yield ProductsProtocols like Pendle enable trading of future yield streams, allowing investors to lock in returns or speculate on interest rates.Yield tokenization separates principal from yield, creating new financial instruments.Fixed-rate lending protocols offer predictable returns without lockup periods.Tokenized yield, fully owned and held by users, can be taken and used in other financial products.Real-World Asset IntegrationMakerDAO allocated $750 million to U.S. Treasury investments.Centrifuge enabled $300 million in real-world asset financing.Ondo Finance launched tokenized notes yielding 5.5% APY backed by T-bills.Goldfinch facilitated $170 million in loans to real-world businesses.Novel Financial Capabilities:Flash Loans: Instant, no-cap, uncollateralized loans for atomic transactions.Liquid Staking: Earn staking yields while maintaining asset liquidity.Composable Yield: Stack multiple yield-generating strategies.Automated Portfolio Management: Smart contracts automatically optimize returns across protocols.DeFi is not without its risks. Smart contract risk, price oracle risk, governance attack risk, and more, are constantly present in decentralized financial systems. These risks have historically been very costly to both the protocols and users. Nonetheless, the DeFi sector has made significant progress in risk management, with losses from exploits declining 40% year-over-year in 2024. This improvement reflects a more careful approach to protocol design and planning, and maturing security practices including comprehensive audits, decentralized insurance protocols and bug bounties.The future of DeFi will be shaped by three converging forces: regulatory maturation, institutional adoption, and infrastructure hardening. The 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Europe's MICA framework created blueprints for compliance, while the new U.S. administration's crypto task force aims to modernize securities classifications, critical steps as protocols like Aave now handle deposits ($23 billion, comparable to mid-tier U.S. banks). With Blackrock and other sophisticated actors joining the fray, traditional finance's plumbing is merging with DeFi's programmable efficiency. The endgame isn't about replacement anymore but symbiosis: 24/7 access to financial products both from the digital and the real world, with transparent, quick and cheap settlement coexisting—and improving—alongside legacy systems. While challenges around security and decentralization remain, the combination of improving infrastructure, maturing risk management and security standards, and deepening liquidity suggests DeFi is evolving from an experimental nascent sector into an increasingly important component of modern financial markets.Tokenized AssetsTokenized assets are revolutionizing finance, making it more efficient, transparent, accessible 24/7, and borderless.In 2025, splitting a dinner bill on Venmo feels as routine as sending a text. Yet when it comes to "serious" finance—wiring money, settling stocks, or closing a cross-border deal—we're suddenly teleported back to the era of dial-up internet: a long and cumbersome process involving too much paperwork, middlemen, and long waiting periods. Want to send money across borders? First, your bank takes their cut, then the intermediary bank, and finally the receiving bank. By the time your money arrives you've lost on fees and waited days for the privilege.The problem is not just speed or cost—it's fragmentation. Stocks settle in days, bonds carry burdensome custodian bureaucracy, and real estate deals move at a snail's pace. In the age of advanced AI and supercomputers in our pockets, we're still moving money and assets like it's the last century.But change is coming. Stablecoins cracked the code first. They showed money could move at internet speed: global, 24/7, and for pennies. Now, the rest of the financial world is catching up. Real-world assets, from U.S. Treasuries to stocks and commodities, are being tokenized. The future of finance is being built for the digital age, where assets move with the same speed, ease and freedom as information itself.StablecoinsThe $205 billion stablecoin market represents a clear and direct response to inefficiencies in legacy financial systems. Unlike speculative crypto assets, stablecoins—digital coins designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, typically a fiat currency like the US dollar—solve tangible problems: high latency, exorbitant fees, the growing demand for programmable money. The core tenet is simple: In today's age, moving money shouldn't take longer than sending an email, and should be practically just as cheap.The stablecoin evolution mirrors the early days of money market funds, in which innovation outpaced regulation until systemic risks, and the ever-growing inefficiencies of the system, forced standardization. Today's stablecoin landscape sits at a similar inflection point. And we are past the point of proof-of-concept.PayPal's PYUSD, collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, now processes $3 billion monthly in B2B transactions, according to Paxos attestations.A survey, conducted by PayPal and Deloitte on merchant adoption of digital currency payments, including stablecoins, found that 93% of merchants that currently accept cryptocurrencies reported an increase in customer base.Société Générale's EURCV facilitates €500 million/day in intra-European trade settlements, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain for atomic delivery-versus-payment.BBVA is developing its own stablecoin solution in partnership with Visa using VTAP, Visa's platform that enables financial institutions to create and manage digital tokens backed by fiat currencies.Stripe recently made a strategic move by acquiring ($1.1B) a major stablecoin infrastructure provider. The list goes on.Consider the process of a €50 transfer from Berlin to Bangkok. Through traditional channels, BBVA's corporate clients pay up to 200bps in fees and lose three days to correspondent banking checks. With Société Générale's EURCV stablecoin, the same transaction settles in 12 seconds, for €0.25, whether it's 2 PM on Monday or 3 AM on Christmas Eve, including automated OFAC screening. The implications are significant.Regulatory MaturationGlobal regulators are increasingly aligning on core principles for stablecoin oversight, though their specific approaches differ, and reflect local market conditions and different regulatory priorities.The European Union has taken a comprehensive approach through MICA, classifying stablecoins as electronic money and requiring issuers to maintain minimum capital reserves of €350,000. European regulators have also implemented strict oversight in place, with mandatory monthly attestations from approved audit firms.In Asia, approaches vary. Abu Dhabi's Financial Services Regulatory Authority has introduced a Fiat-Referenced Token framework. Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill, introduced in December 2024, requires HKMA licensing and establishes substantial liquidity requirements of HK$25 million for issuers. Singapore has reinforced its crypto-friendly stance by granting anti-suit injunctions in stablecoin disputes.In Australia, the country's treasury has proposed requiring non-bank stablecoin issuers to maintain 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets, with major issuers exceeding A$100 million requiring APRA authorization. Australian regulators have also classified stablecoins as stored-value facilities under existing payment regulations, through their token mapping initiative.In contrast to developed markets, emerging economies present a different regulatory picture. Across Africa, stablecoins have gained significant traction in countries like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, where they serve as a hedge against volatile local currencies and provide more affordable remittance options.Finally, President Trump's re-election has ushered in a new era of crypto-friendly policies in the United States. His administration has taken a more supportive stance towards cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The newly established cryptocurrency working group will propose new regulations and explore the creation of a national strategic digital asset stockpile. Trump has appointed crypto advocates to key positions, including Paul Atkins as SEC head and Scott Bessent to lead the Treasury Department.The stablecoin ecosystem has matured beyond proof-of-concept to practical implementation, with major financial institutions' integrations. As regulatory frameworks mature and institutional adoption grows, stablecoins will emerge as a fundamental component of the modernizing financial infrastructure.Expansive Addressable Markets & Future Predictions"The future will be tokenized""We believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets, and that means every stock, every bond [...] will be on one general ledger"Larry Fink - Blackrock's CEO97% of institutions surveyed by BNY agree that tokenization will "revolutionize asset management"Expansive Addressable Markets$139T Global Commodities Market$128T Global Bond Market$109T Global Equity Market$21T US M2 Money Supply$11T Real Estate Investment Market$2T Global Private Credit MarketFuture Predictions (sourced by RWA.xyz)$30T Tokenized assets by 2034$16T Tokenized illiquid assets by 2030$5T Tokenized digital securities by 2030$2T Tokenized digital securities by 2030 (appears twice in the table)What Are Real-World Assets (RWAs)?"You don't have to squint too hard to imagine a world where stocks are on blockchains."— Vlad Tenev, CEO of RobinhoodAs discussed in the previous section, stable coins have already demonstrated product-market fit, growing into a $205B market. Now, the industry is ripe for tokenizing other traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries, equities, private credit, and commodities.The traditional financial system keeps securities and money in separate silos, creating unnecessary friction and inefficiency. When one buys a U.S. Treasury, one must first deal with ACH or SWIFT for the cash movement, then navigate clearing houses and custodians for the security itself. Each step requires manual reconciliation, adds cost, and introduces counterparty risk. This inefficiency extends across all traditional assets."Stocks take days to settle. Bonds pass through layers of middlemen. Real estate transactions span weeks or months. The financial world runs on infrastructure built decades ago, trapping trillions in value in outdated systems."BlackRock, one of the key players in traditional finance markets, recognized this opportunity, launching their tokenized fund on a public blockchain. Managing over $500 million in deposits, it offers features impossible in traditional finance: 24/7 liquidity, automated dividend payments, and instant settlement. Franklin Templeton followed with their own $270 million on-chain U.S. Government money market fund. The momentum is building.SWIFT, processing $150 trillion annually, announced that starting in 2025, banks worldwide will use their infrastructure for trial blockchain transactions. HSBC has tokenized gold, JP Morgan has been granted a trademark for J.P. MORGAN WALLET, which will allow cryptocurrency transfers, and UBS is piloting blockchain-based multi-currency payment solutions.For institutional investors, the implications are significant. Assets that move onchain gain programmability, instant settlement, and round-the-clock trading. More importantly, they can interact with other digital assets seamlessly - imagine using tokenized U.S. Treasuries as collateral for other investments, or real estate tokens that automatically distribute rental income. What started with stablecoins is expanding to encompass the entire financial system. The question isn't whether traditional assets will move on-chain, but when and how quickly the transformation will occur.Examples of RWAsReal Estate: Tokenization allows fractional ownership of properties, increasing liquidity & lowering entry barriers for investors.Art and Collectibles: High-value artworks & rare collectibles can be tokenized, enabling fractional ownership & broader investment opportunities.Commodities: Physical commodities like precious metals, agricultural products, & energy resources can be tokenized for easier trading and investment.Financial Instruments: Stocks, bonds, & other securities can be represented as tokens, potentially streamlining trading & settlement processes.Intellectual Property: Patents, trademarks, & other intangible assets can be tokenized, creating new value streams for businesses.Case StudiesBlackRock's BUIDL Fund: Launched on Ethereum in March 2024, managing over $517 million with features like 24/7 liquidity and on-chain yield.Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund: The first U.S.-registered mutual fund using a public blockchain, reaching $270 million in assets by March 2023.HSBC Gold Tokenization: Successfully tokenized physical gold, offering institutional investors blockchain-based fractional ownership and increased liquidity.UBS Digital Cash Pilot: Completed a blockchain-based multi-currency payment solution pilot in late 2024, demonstrating efficient cross-border transactions.JP Morgan's Onyx Platform: Processes $1-2 billion in daily transactions, facilitating cross-border and institutional payment solutions.Sotheby's Metaverse: Launched in 2021, it has facilitated the sale of tokenized art and collectibles, including blue-chip NFTs and digital representations of physical artworks.RealT: A platform tokenizing real estate, allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership in properties for as little as $50.Tokenization Value and Number of Products TokenizedTokenized assets have already surpassed $145 billion. (Graph showing Tokenized Assets value and Number of Tokenized Products from 01/2020 to 01/2025).Staking and restaking: foundational primitives for trust-less decentralized systemsIn recent years, blockchain networks moved away from proof-of-work, an energy intensive method to secure blockchains, popularized by Bitcoin, and towards more sustainable and incentive-driven security models, such as proof-of-stake.At the heart of it all lies staking, a foundational mechanism where participants lock digital assets to validate transactions and secure networks. This powers many major platforms, including, among others, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Binance Smart Chain. These chains exemplify how staking aligns economic incentives with network integrity, and how it enables scalable and energy-efficient operations.Staking's success has naturally led to innovations like restaking, which allows already-staked assets to support additional services. Restaking removes the need for new networks and applications to bootstrap their own security infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage and rely on existing networks and their robust decentralized security. However, restaking remains entirely optional—like added floors to a solid foundation—while staking itself remains the core infrastructure.With over $200 billion already secured through staking, understanding this foundational mechanism has become essential for institutional participants entering the blockchain space. The following section examines staking's mechanics in detail, exploring how it creates a robust security framework while generating sustainable yields for participants."Staking secures networks, rewards users, and strengthens decentralization, making it a key part of blockchain technology"What is Staking?Think of staking like buying government bonds. When you purchase a bond, you're essentially lending money to the government to help fund public services. In return, you earn interest as a reward for your contribution. Staking works in much the same way: You lock up digital assets to support a network's operations, earning rewards while making the system more secure. This mechanism is fundamental to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, which have emerged as a more energy-efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin.The mechanics are straightforward: when one stakes assets, one essentially puts up collateral to verify transactions and maintain network security. Imagine joining the neighborhood watch, taking turns with other neighbors to keep an eye out and the community safer as a result. The more you stake, the bigger your proportionate contribution to overall network security, and the more rewards you earn.What makes staking particularly interesting for institutional investors is its role in the broader financial ecosystem. Unlike mining Bitcoin, which requires massive energy consumption and specialized hardware, staking is remarkably efficient. A single staking operation can secure billions in transactions using the same energy as a typical laptop.Today, over 33 million ETH and over 390 million SOL—with a combined worth of ~$200 billion—are being staked on their respective blockchains, with participants earning between 3-4% annually for helping secure the network.Why Staking Secures Ethereum?Blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are like massive, public supercomputers. Transactions on the chain include value transfer, buys and sells on open markets, interest payments and a myriad of other social and financial transactions. These networks rely on thousands of independent processors (stakers) to verify transactions, working together against collusion and malicious actors attempting to potentially extract value from the system.This is crucial for safety: If only several actors had authority over transaction verifications, these actors could potentially collude to manipulate the system in various ways. To collude against the entire network, one would need to bribe 51% of the network validators which is expensive and unrealistic.Moreover, should someone try to collude against the network, their stake, meaning their locked capital will be penalized. Security through financial self-interest—the oldest trick in the capitalism book. Some validators are large companies, others are tech geeks, many are small operators, each running their own setups across the globe. This diversity makes it practically impossible for an attacker to convince thousands of independent operators to collude.34M ETHOver 1m Validators have collectively staked 34m ETH to secure Ethereum's Proof of Stake consensus mechanisms. (Graph showing staked ETH amount from 01/2022 to 01/2024).RestakingRestaking lets you reuse the same staked assets (like ETH or SOL) to secure multiple blockchain services at once.Imagine a security deposit that covers not just your apartment but also your car rental and gym membership. If you break any agreement, you risk losing the deposit - but if you follow the rules, you earn rewards across all services.If staking is a foundational blockchain primitive, restaking is a new layer; a primitive built on top of a primitive. When you stake assets, you lock them up to help validate network transactions. In return, you earn ~3-4% annual rewards.Protocols like EigenLayer and Solayer let users "reuse" those staked assets to secure other services (e.g., data oracles, rollups). Users agree to penalties ("slashing conditions") should they misbehave.Example: If you restake ETH to secure Eoracle (a data provider), you earn extra yield but risk losing ETH if eOracle's data is incorrect.Restaking and Information AsymmetryMarkets thrive on and require trust, but verifying trustworthiness has always been challenging. This information asymmetry—where one party knows more than the other—traditionally required elaborate systems of regulators, reputation systems, and even insurance to manage. Now imagine if the seller had to put their own money on the line. This is the birth of marketplaces for decentralized trust. When validators stake significant capital against their behavior, one need not trust their intentions; one can simply trust that validators are rational actors prioritizing their economic incentives.Why Does Restaking Matter?Restaking is transforming how blockchain networks achieve security & trust. We've created a new form of financial primitive that lets capital work harder than ever before. Traditional networks face a chicken-and-egg problem: they need security to attract users, but can't afford security without users. Restaking breaks this cycle by creating a marketplace for security, where established networks can "lease" their security to newer ones. This new concept—a true marketplace for decentralized trust—is a unique property derived from these new blockchain-based primitives. Beyond that:Asset managers earn compounded yields (staking + restaking rewards) on the same collateral. For example, Staking ETH yields ~3-4% per annum. Restaking could add 1-4%, or even more, on top of that, depending on risk.Restaking forces participants to "put their money where their mouth is." Validators risk losing their stake if they validate bad data or try to collude to somehow attack the network.New blockchains and services no longer need to bootstrap their own token and security. They can "rent" the capital staked on Ethereum or Solana. EigenLayer has roughly $20 billion in ETH securing services beyond just Ethereum itself.The Real-World Applications of RestakingRestaking is already gaining traction, with multiple protocols being built on top of this technology:TVL Growth (EigenLayer)10% - Around 10% of ETH has been restaked, securing multiple on-chain services. (Graph showing TVL growth from 01/01/2024 to 01/01/2025).Oracles: Securely provide off-chain data for smart contracts.Data Availability Layers: Ensure that decentralized applications have access to reliable data storage.Rollups: Strengthen the scalability layers that process transactions off-chain before settling on Ethereum.Coprocessors: Enable functionalities like offchain computation for decentralized applications.We're witnessing the birth of something entirely unique: a marketplace for trust itself. The same way Amazon created a marketplace for goods and Airbnb created a marketplace for spaces, restaking is creating a marketplace for decentralized security. The infrastructure is built and being improved upon, the economic incentives are there and aligned between the various stakeholders. This new primitive has the potential to reshape how we align incentives to build trust and bootstrap ecosystems at scale.AI Agents Won't Queue at Banks—They'll Go OnchainImagine a brilliant mind locked in a room. It can solve impossible problems, create amazing pieces of art, and generate code that can change the world—but it can't open the door. That's AI today: revolutionary in its capabilities but trapped by the limits of the systems we've built for humans.Traditional finance is the locked door. It wasn't designed for entities that don't have ID, don't have credit histories, don't have a valid address and don't stand in line at banks. AI agents, capable of transacting faster than any human, are stuck in a world where every payment requires paperwork, intermediaries, and infrastructure they can't access.Crypto is the key. With blockchain, AI agents finally have the tools they need to break free. Wallets can be created in seconds, transactions settle instantly, and micropayments flow seamlessly across borders. This isn't just a door opening—it's a gateway to an entirely new economy. The combination of AI and crypto is rewriting the rules of finance, technology, and human interaction.AIThe story of AI development reads more like science fiction than reality. We've come a long way from ELIZA (1966) to beating champions at chess (Deep Blue, 1997) and Go (AlphaGo, 2016), to generating human-like text and art in today's age. AI has evolved from narrow, specific tasks to increasingly general capabilities, and experts estimate that we are less than a decade away from artificial superintelligence.One of the pivotal moments came in 2012 with the introduction of AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), winning the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). The next major breakthrough came in 2017 with transformers, presented by Google researchers in their seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need". Transformers became the go-to foundational basis for many modern AI systems, including Open AI's GPT series, the dominant force in the AI market in terms of market share (60%). Today, AI is everywhere. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company at $3.45 trillion. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months.The centralization of AI has highlighted fundamental challenges. Building and operating massive AI infrastructure requires an intense amount of capital, solidifying Big Tech's dominance with a very high barrier for entry. A handful of companies now control one of humanity's most powerful technologies, leading to dangerous levels of concentration over the data they use and how it's deployed. Training data is scraped from the internet without consent or compensation, creating both ethical and legal quandaries. Models perpetuate existing biases while operating as "black boxes" that even their creators struggle to explain.But something unexpected happened along the way: It turns out that AI—and its next logical evolution, AI agents—and distributed public ledgers are a match made in heaven. Digital agents that can reason, create, and analyze at superhuman speed found themselves constrained by the inability to handle money or make truly impactful autonomous decisions.Enter decentralized AI: the fusion of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Decentralized AI offers a fundamentally different approach. Instead of concentrating power in corporate hands, it distributes control across networks of participants.Blockchain provides transparent governance of data sources, ensuring creators can control how their work is used and receive fair compensation.The immutable nature of blockchain creates audit trails for dataset compliance and model outputs.Decentralized AI democratizes access. Small players and researchers can access distributed compute networks instead of requiring access to massive data centers.Communities can collectively govern AI development through DAOs.Truth Terminal and GOATThe story of Truth Terminal is a unique one. Truth Terminal is an AI chatbot created by Andy Ayrey, a New Zealand developer, as an experimental project. An anonymous creator launched a digital token called GOAT, sent part of the token supply to Truth Terminal's digital wallets, and tagged Truth Terminal on Twitter. The chat bot took a liking to it. Truth Terminal's involvement and endorsement rapidly drove its market cap to over $1 billion. The AI accumulated $40 million in crypto holdings without ever needing a bank account, effectively becoming the world's first artificial millionaire.Platforms like Akash Network offer a decentralized cloud computing marketplace.Networks like Bittensor incentivize distributed model improvement.Projects like ai16z uses AI agents to analyze on-chain data and execute investment strategies. Their open-source Eliza framework has become a standard for building autonomous agents, attracting over 3,500 GitHub stars.Virtuals is pioneering AI-powered digital identities that can operate autonomously across blockchain platforms.(Graph showing # of stars on GitHub for AI agent frameworks from 10/3/23 to 1/6/25).As AI systems gain more autonomy and blockchain networks mature, we're approaching an inflection point where machines can meaningfully participate in the digital economy. Imagine a self-driving car that could automatically pay for its own charging, maintenance, and insurance through micro-transactions. This new paradigm is what decentralized AI is gunning for.Blockchains are transparent by nature—ZK and FHE are to web3 what curtains are to showersBlockchains are inherently transparent. Every transaction is recorded on an immutable public ledger. While this transparency enables unprecedented levels of verification and trust, it also creates significant privacy challenges.If the Web3 ecosystem hopes to attract major traditional finance players to adopt blockchain technology, maintaining the privacy standards that these players might expect becomes critical.Two breakthrough technologies are transforming how privacy works in the blockchain era: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). These cryptographic innovations enable selective disclosure—proving specific facts without revealing underlying data. They're already being adopted by major institutions: cities like Buenos Aires are using ZK proofs for citizen identity verification, while financial institutions are implementing these technologies for regulatory compliance and secure data sharing.What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) enable verification of sensitive claims without exposing the underlying data.Imagine a job applicant cryptographically proving they hold valid citizenship without disclosing any identifying information. The result? The employer learns only whether the applicant meets the requirement—nothing more, a principle called "privacy-preserving verification".Who's Building with ZK Technology?ZK proofs are already powering use cases across sectors:Government & Public Services: Buenos Aires uses a ZK-powered system called QuarkID to protect residents' privacy.Finance & Blockchain: Project Mandala, led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, tests automated compliance systems for cross-border transactions using ZKPs. Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, uses ZK proofs to encrypt transaction details on a public ledger.Web Infrastructure: Brave Browser is developing zkSENSE, a ZK proof system for privacy-preserving bot detection. Cloudflare leverages ZK to verify hardware security keys.Furthermore, Zero-knowledge proofs will potentially become essential as AI agents become more common. Companies will need to prove facts about private datasets without exposing raw data.What is FHE?Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) processes encrypted data directly—like performing surgery on a fully covered patient. Imagine a poker game where players compare hands while cards stay sealed in envelopes. FHE works similarly: computations (e.g., tallying votes, training AI models) happen entirely on the encrypted data itself, with results remaining encrypted until decrypted by authorized parties.Think of FHE as a privacy force field for data:Encryption: You scramble your data into gibberish using a secret key.Run blind computations: Send the gibberish to a cloud service, AI model, or blockchain. They perform tasks on it without ever seeing the original data.Decryption: Only authorized parties can 'unscramble' the final answer.Why we need FHE?Ordinary encryption is like a safe: once you open it, the data is exposed. FHE is different—it's a safe that lets people work with what's inside while it's still locked. This solves a critical problem where today, companies must decrypt your data to use it, creating hacking and privacy risks.The number of possible future applications is staggering:Decentralized Governance: Enables confidential voting systems where votes are tallied transparently while individual choices remain private.AI: Model training can be performed on encrypted datasets, allowing healthcare institutions to improve diagnostic accuracy without exposing sensitive patient records.Gaming: Enables truly private on-chain gaming experiences, such as poker.Pharmaceuticals: Analyze vast datasets of encrypted genetic information with FHE.ZK proofs and fully homomorphic encryption are very complimentary in nature. ZK Proofs allow users to prove a fact is true without revealing details. FHE allows the processing of that data without ever seeing it. Combined, they create systems where data stays hidden but remains useful.Safety is Crypto's Achilles HeelImagine living in a house made entirely of glass. Everyone can see everything inside—that's what Web3 is like today. Its openness allows trust and transparency, but it also means anyone can see your assets and figure out how to take them.Just like people found ways to secure houses—curtains, alarms, and locked doors—Web3 is creating its own protections. Bug bounties reward those who spot code issues. Audits act like safety checks. Monitoring tools work like security cameras. And wallets now simulate transactions to warn users before they make risky moves. These tools don't hide what's inside the glass house, but they make it much harder for anyone to take what's yours.Yearly total value stolen in crypto hacks and number of hacks (2015-2024)(Graph showing Total Value Stolen and Total Number of Hacks from 2015 to 2024. Total Value Stolen is a bar chart peaking in 2022; Total Number of Hacks is a line graph peaking around 2021/2022 and rising again in 2023/2024).Safety has long been a critical challenge in the crypto industry. From the infamous Mt. Gox breach in 2011 to the $620 million Ronin Bridge exploit in 2022, history teaches us that crypto's security issues can indeed be very costly. In 2024 alone, more than $2 billion were lost in over 300 separate attack incidents.At the heart of crypto's security flaws is an intrinsic vulnerability. Unlike in the traditional tech and finance world, where attackers typically steal data, crypto exploits often grant direct access to financial assets (real money).The threat landscape in crypto is very diverse, ranging from rogue insiders and organized crime groups like Inferno, to state-sponsored actors such as North Korea's Lazarus group.This risky environment has been one of the largest obstacles in our industry's quest for mass adoption. Non-native users must navigate an almost militaristic level of operational security just to interact with on-chain applications.Yet, there are multiple reasons to be optimistic. Recent improvements in security have begun to shift the balance.Protocols are running thorough audits over their smart contracts.Bug bounty programs have become an essential part of the ecosystem, rewarding ethical hackers.Proactive monitoring systems like those developed by Venn and Forta are now capable of blocking malicious transactions before they are even executed.These technological advancements have collectively driven a remarkable 40% year-over-year drop in the dollar value of exploits suffered by DeFi in 2024.In parallel, compliance has made significant improvements. Companies such as Chainalysis, TRM, and Elliptic have built sophisticated systems to monitor wallets suspected of being tied to malicious activity.As more teams continue to build new state-of-the-art safety infrastructure—with a disproportionate percentage of them being based in Israel—one of the largest barriers preventing the onboarding of billions of users will be torn down.DePIN allows companies to build infrastructure with unprecedented speed & efficiency through tokenized incentivesIn 2007, Google Street View set out to map the world's roads the way big companies always had: with a fleet of custom vehicles, hired drivers, and a massive budget. It took Google 12 years to map 10 million miles. Then Hivemapper came along.Instead of corporate teams, ordinary people with $400 dashcams now suddenly earned tokens for mapping out roads during their daily routines. In under two years, Hivemapper managed to successfully map 26% of the world's roads, including a large portion of North America, Europe, Japan, and South Korea.The plan is to rethink infrastructure from the ground up. The real power isn't in capital or heavy machinery. It's in the eight billion people already shaping the world around them. That's the idea behind DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Instead of a single company owning everything, these networks reward people for sharing what they already have: dashcams, spare internet bandwidth, even unused battery power from electric cars.The numbers back the trend: DePIN projects are now worth over $32 billion, covering everything from wireless networks to AI training data. They're cheaper to launch and bootstrap, faster to scale, and having no single point of failure makes these systems remarkably resilient. Token incentives drive forth participation as well as scale.What is DePIN?Think about how Airbnb transformed hospitality forever. Instead of building hotels, AirBNB had people turn their spare rooms into a global network of accommodations. Uber did the same for transportation. DePIN follows this model but for infrastructure.Every gaming PC has the potential to become part of a decentralized computing grid. Home WiFi routers can join a worldwide wireless network. Electric vehicle charging stations can form a community-owned power grid. Traditional infrastructure demands massive upfront investment into development and maintenance. DePIN not only crowdsources the funding aspect, it also crowdsources the actual work.Why It MattersDePIN networks scale globally in ways traditional companies simply can't in this day and age. Hivemapper mapped 25% of the world's roads in under two years by incentivizing everyday drivers. Through token incentives, DePIN networks turn unused resources into productive assets, scale through community participation, and create systems that are more resilient and dynamic because they're decentralized.The Rise of DePINThe concept of decentralized infrastructure isn't new. In 2013, Helium pioneered the model for wireless networks, followed by Storj in 2014 for cloud storage. But it wasn't until recently that technological advances made widespread adoption possible. The proliferation of smartphones, high-speed internet, and GPS enabled ordinary devices to become useful infrastructure nodes. The sector has grown significantly—from early experiments to a $32 billion market with daily trading volumes near $3 billion.The challenges and hidden costsWhile DePIN reduces upfront capital requirements, it also introduces new complexities.Node operators face ongoing costs for hardware, electricity, and maintenance. The economics only work, at scale, if token incentives and rewards outpace expenses.Token incentives drive growth but can also create instability. Many projects have struggled with token price volatility affecting network reliability.Decentralization can also create reliability issues. A network of low-end, consumer-grade devices can't possibly match the consistency of industrial-grade infrastructure.Regulatory uncertainty. Questions about liability, data privacy, and security remain largely unanswered.Total USD spent on Akash, a prominent DePIN company(Graph showing Total USD Spent on Akash, increasing rapidly from 2022 to 2025).Crypto is ready for the masses: infrastructure improvements are paving the way for lower costs, faster transactions, and a better user experienceSending money internationally in the 90s meant dealing with expensive fees, complex processes, and long wait times. Today, the same transfers happen and settle much quicker, all around the world, and at a fraction of the cost.Web3 and blockchain technology is going through a similar transformation.In 2021, basic transactions on Ethereum could cost over $60 in network fees.Today, those same transactions cost mere cents.While market headlines focus on prices and speculation, quiet but profound advances are making blockchain systems truly ready for mainstream use. The most notable improvements are the significant decrease in transaction costs and the implementation of account abstraction.Scaling Solutions Transform User ExperienceThe early days of blockchain were defined by tradeoffs: interacting with Ethereum's smart contracts came at the cost of slow speeds, and volatile and exorbitant fees. Layer 2 networks like Base and Arbitrum, and high-performance blockchains like Solana have dramatically improved transaction throughput while maintaining security. Applications built on these networks deliver experiences comparable to traditional applications, processing thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality.(Graph showing Median Gas Price on Ethereum (Gwei) from 2021 to 2025, illustrating a significant drop in recent years).Account Abstraction: Transforming Wallets into Smart ToolsIf scaling solutions solved blockchain's speed and cost problems, account abstraction (AA) aims to solve its 'human' problem. The old model of the externally-owned account (EOA) tasked users with managing seed phrases, calculating gas fees, and holding native tokens to power transactions, a workflow so alien and tedious for regular mainstream users that it became one of crypto's largest adoption barriers.By implementing ERC-4337 and ushering in account abstraction, the Ethereum network upgraded wallets into smart accounts—programmable interfaces that automate complexity.(Graph showing Number of Monthly Active Smart Accounts on Ethereum Mainnet from 2021 to 2025, illustrating rapid growth).Consumer Applications BreakthroughThe emergence of user-friendly applications demonstrates blockchain's readiness for mainstream adoption:The mobile app Moonshot has transformed digital asset trading by allowing users to purchase tokens directly and instantly, with traditional payment methods. With over 20 million users onboarded, Moonshot proves that blockchain applications can achieve mass-market adoption when technical complexity is removed, adopting 'the hidden blockchain' thesis.Prediction markets like Limitless and Polymarket allow users to bet on real-world events. During the 2024 U.S. election cycle, a staggering $3.7 billion flowed into contracts. Polymarket’s success—314,000 active traders throughout 2024 and over $9 billion in trading volume for the year—signals a paradigm shift. However, allegations of wash trading and market manipulation have surfaced.(Graph showing Polymarket's monthly new accounts from 09/2020 to 01/2025, skyrocketing due to the November U.S. election).The improvements mentioned above are finally allowing crypto apps to breakthrough to mainstream users and usher in mass adoption.Decentralized Social Networks: InnovationA new modelDecentralized social networks fundamentally change this dynamic by building on open protocols rather than closed platforms. This shift transforms three key areas: Innovation, ownership and shared social graphs.Innovation: Open protocols allow developers to build without fear of restrictions or censorship.True Digital Ownership: Users on decentralized networks own their content, identity, and relationships. Your connections remain intact across different applications.Shared social graphs: Decentralized networks solve the cold-start problem by allowing applications to share a common social graph.ChallengesCold-start problem: Convincing users to transition from established platforms where their social circles already exist to a new, decentralized network proves difficult.Complexity: Many require users to understand concepts like blockchain technology and private keys.Content Moderation: No single-entity control is a double-edged sword; freedom often comes with the lack of content moderation.Scaling: Accommodating large-scale numbers of users and transactions efficiently.Notable examplesLens Protocol: A decentralized social graph built on the Polygon blockchain that prioritizes user ownership and content portability. Feature: "Collect," which enables creators to directly monetize their content as NFTs.Farcaster: A decentralized social network that emphasizes user ownership and interoperability. User base expanded from under 50,000 at the beginning of 2024 to approximately 750,000 by January 2025. Unique feature: "Frames," which allows users to embed interactive decentralized applications within their posts.Reddit: Experimenting with blockchain technology, implementing projects like Community Points, which rewards Reddit users with tokens for their contributions.Friend.tech: An innovative platform that tokenized social interactions. Despite initial success, it experienced a dramatic decline and announced its closure by September 2024.Fantasy.top: An Ethereum-based NFT game that transforms Twitter influencers into tradable collectible cards. Quickly became one of the most profitable crypto applications, but has faced challenges with manipulated social media engagement.(Graph showing Daily active users on Farcaster, the largest decentralized social network, from 10/2021 to 01/2025).Crypto Speaks HebrewThe story goes: In November 2013, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin visited Israel, drawn by the country's thriving Bitcoin community at the time. During his stay, he met with the teams behind Mastercoin and Colored Coins, including Yoni Assia, who was also building what later became the financial giant eToro. It was in Israel, surrounded by local builders and inspired by their work, that Buterin came up with the idea for Ethereum.This story is but one tale in a larger story about how, from the very early days, Israeli innovators had a profound influence on blockchain technology and the general crypto industry.Dr. Yonatan Sompolinsky and Professor Aviv Zohar were both mentioned in Ethereum's original whitepaper.Amir Chetrit, from the Colored Coins team, joined Ethereum as a co-founder.Shafi Goldwasser, co-inventor of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, developed the cryptographic backbone for most of today's blockchain privacy solutions.Professor Eli Ben Sasson, who helped create Zcash, went on to co-found StarkWare, one of the largest scalability-focused blockchains in the industry and a deca-unicorn.Dan Boneh, a leader in cryptographic research and co-director of the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research, authored foundational work.Security = SurvivalIf there is one thing Israel excels at, it is security. This particular expertise comes from necessity: Israel's decades-long geopolitical situation demands uncompromising innovation in defense and cybersecurity. Mandatory military service—particularly in elite cyber units like the famous 8200—immerses young talent in high-stakes problem-solving.Adi Shamir, the 'S' in RSA, whose secret-sharing technology is embedded in wallets like Ledger and Trezor.Michael Shaulov, co-founded Fireblocks, the #1 institutional custodian in crypto today.Itay Malinger, a recipient of the Israel Defense Prize, developed a multiparty computation company (Curv) that PayPal acquired for approx. $200 million.Yehuda Lindell, another pioneer in MPC, built a solution that was acquired by Coinbase.Companies like Blockaid, which secures MetaMask, and SphereX, are among the most recognized security projects in the space. Chaos Labs manages risk for Uniswap and Chainlink. Hexagate was recently acquired by Chainalysis. Even Ethereum's key standards bear Israel's mark—ERC-4377 was co-authored by Yoav Weiss.Israel's Secret SauceIsrael's rise as a tech powerhouse is a fascinating story of adaptation and innovation.Educated Workforce: Forty-five percent of Israelis hold a university degree, placing Israel 5th globally. Israel ranks 4th in the world for the number of top universities per capita.Military Service: Mandatory military service has become an unexpected tech incubator. Recruits acquire practical skills and problem-solving abilities from a young age.Meritocracy: The Israeli army is renowned for its meritocracy and horizontal structure. Soldiers are not only encouraged but also rewarded for going beyond their assigned tasks.Intelligence Units: Units such as 8200 and Matzov play a critical role. Over 1,000 companies have been launched by graduates of Unit 8200.ChallengesRegulatory uncertainty: Israel's regulatory stance on crypto remains ambiguous. Regulators continue to classify most digital assets as securities, with very little nuance, hindering DeFi innovation.October 7th and Geopolitics: For three months, 60% of tech professionals under 40 were called up as reservists. The impact is long-lasting, leading some founders to relocate teams.Talent drain: Israel's tech sector faces a significant talent drain, intensified by the highly-contested 2023 judicial reforms and geopolitical tensions. This led to 36% of company managers reporting hiring challenges, and for 33% of startups to consider relocation.Israel's Crypto EcosystemThe Israeli Crypto Ecosystem is a convergence of risk-taking entrepreneurs, academic luminaries, and intelligence experts.
