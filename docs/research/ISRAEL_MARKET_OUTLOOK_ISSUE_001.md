## From the Desk of [GP Name]

In November, Paxos—the company that powers PayPal's crypto infrastructure—quietly acquired Fordefi, an Israeli crypto wallet company you've probably never heard of.

The price wasn't disclosed. But sources close to the deal suggest north of $100 million for a company founded in 2021 with roughly 50 employees.

This isn't news. This is a pattern.

In 2021, PayPal acquired Curv—an Israeli MPC wallet company—for $200 million. In 2022, Coinbase acquired Unbound Security—another Israeli cryptography company—for over $100 million. In January 2025, Coinbase acquired Spindl. And now Fordefi.

The world's largest financial institutions keep buying Israeli crypto companies. The question worth asking isn't "why this company?" It's "why Israel?"

This month's issue explores that pattern—and what it means for investors positioning in the Israeli crypto ecosystem.

## Featured Story

# The Acquirers Keep Coming
### Why the World's Largest Financial Institutions Buy Israeli Crypto Companies

**Fordefi → Paxos** | November 2025 | ~$100M+

---

Josh Schwartz had a problem most founders would envy.

By late 2025, Fordefi had nearly 300 institutional clients processing $120 billion in monthly transaction volume. The company's MPC wallet technology—originally developed to solve the "single point of failure" problem in crypto custody—had become essential infrastructure for hedge funds, asset managers, and crypto-native institutions.

Growth was strong. The product worked. And then Paxos came calling.

For Paxos—the infrastructure company behind PayPal's crypto offerings—Fordefi represented something specific: Israeli cryptographic expertise that would take years to build internally. The same expertise that had made Curv attractive to PayPal. The same expertise that had made Unbound attractive to Coinbase.

The acquisition closed in November. Most of Fordefi's 50 employees—including about 35 based in Tel Aviv—joined Paxos. Another Israeli crypto company absorbed into the global financial infrastructure stack.

---

### The Pattern

**Why do acquirers keep buying Israeli?**

The acquisition history tells a consistent story:

| Company | Acquirer | Year | Price | Technology |
|---------|----------|------|-------|------------|
| Curv | PayPal | 2021 | $200M | MPC Wallets |
| Unbound Security | Coinbase | 2022 | $100M+ | MPC Cryptography |
| Fireblocks | — | 2022 | $8B valuation | Custody Infrastructure |
| Spindl | Coinbase | 2025 | Undisclosed | Web3 Attribution |
| Fordefi | Paxos | 2025 | ~$100M+ | MPC Wallets |

The pattern isn't coincidental. It reflects something structural about where cryptographic expertise lives.

---

### The Source

**Where Israeli Crypto Expertise Comes From**

To understand why Israeli companies dominate crypto infrastructure, you need to understand two institutions most international investors have never heard of: Unit 8200 and Talpiot.

**Unit 8200** is Israel's signals intelligence unit—roughly equivalent to the NSA, but with a crucial difference. Israel has mandatory military service. This means 8200 alumni include not just career intelligence officers, but thousands of engineers who receive elite cryptography and security training, then return to civilian life in their early twenties.

The statistics are striking:
- ~50% of Israeli tech exits valued over $100M were founded by 8200 alumni
- Average acquisition value for 8200-founded companies: $317 million
- Notable alumni companies: Waze, Wix, Check Point, Viber

**Talpiot** is even more selective. Each year, the Israel Defense Forces screen the entire country—9 million people—and select roughly 50 teenagers. Candidates undergo nine years of service combining elite military training with a full academic degree in physics, computer science, or mathematics.

The selection rate is approximately 0.0005%.

These programs produce founders with three characteristics that translate directly to crypto infrastructure:

1. **Cryptographic depth**: Training in encryption, secure communications, and adversarial thinking
2. **Security-first culture**: Building under constraints where failure has real consequences
3. **High-trust networks**: Alumni networks that function as pipelines for talent and capital

When Fordefi needed engineers who understood multi-party computation, they recruited from this pipeline. When Paxos acquired Fordefi, they were acquiring access to that pipeline.

---

### The Fordefi Story

**The Build:**

Fordefi was founded in 2021 by Josh Schwartz, Dima Kogan, and Michael Volfman. The thesis was straightforward: institutional crypto adoption was inevitable, but the custody infrastructure wasn't ready.

Traditional crypto wallets rely on a single private key—lose it or have it stolen, and the funds are gone. For retail users managing small amounts, this is inconvenient. For institutions managing billions, it's unacceptable.

MPC (Multi-Party Computation) solves this by splitting the private key across multiple parties. No single party ever holds the complete key. Transactions require coordinated computation between parties. The cryptography is complex, but the security properties are elegant: no single point of failure, no single point of compromise.

Fordefi built MPC infrastructure specifically for DeFi operations—not just custody, but active management across decentralized protocols. The company raised $28 million from investors including Microsoft's M12, PayPal Ventures, Lightspeed, and Pantera Capital.

**The Validation:**

The client list grew to nearly 300 institutional customers. Transaction volume hit $120 billion monthly. And then Paxos—itself backed by PayPal and processing billions in stablecoin transactions—decided they needed that expertise in-house.

For Fordefi's investors—including Pantera, which also invested in the acquiring company—the acquisition represented a clean exit. For the founders, it represented the latest chapter in a familiar story: Israeli crypto infrastructure becoming global financial infrastructure.

---

### The Bigger Picture

**2025: The Year of Israeli Exits**

Fordefi's acquisition fits a broader pattern. 2025 has been a landmark year for Israeli tech exits:

**Wiz → Google/Alphabet | $32 Billion | March 2025**

The cloud security company founded by four 8200 alumni became the largest Israeli tech acquisition ever—and the largest acquisition in Google's history. From founding in 2020 to $32B exit in five years.

**Fireblocks | $8B Valuation | Still Independent**

The custody infrastructure company—also founded by 8200 alumni—remains independent but represents the template: Israeli cryptographic expertise becoming essential infrastructure for global finance.

**Zengo | Strategic Investment from Tether | February 2025**

The MPC wallet company (1.5 million users, zero hacks since 2018) added the world's largest stablecoin issuer as a strategic backer. Tether doesn't make casual investments.

---

### The Investment Thesis

**What This Pattern Means for NOTALONE LPs**

The acquisition pattern validates a specific thesis: Israeli founders dominate crypto infrastructure because the same skills that protect national security translate directly to protecting digital assets.

This creates a predictable dynamic:
1. Israeli founders build infrastructure companies
2. Those companies become essential to global financial institutions
3. Global institutions acquire the expertise they can't build internally

For NOTALONE, this pattern informs our sourcing strategy. We're not looking for consumer applications or speculative DeFi plays. We're looking for infrastructure companies built by founders from this pipeline—companies that will either become essential infrastructure or acquisition targets for institutions building that infrastructure.

The question isn't whether Israeli crypto companies will continue to be acquired. It's which ones are next.

### What's Moving in Israeli Crypto/AI

**FUNDING**

**Zengo Secures Strategic Investment from Tether** | February 2025
The MPC wallet company—1.5 million users, zero hacks since 2018—added the world's largest stablecoin issuer as a strategic backer. This signals institutional confidence in Israeli custody infrastructure.
→ *NOTALONE Take: Watch for Zengo's institutional product roadmap. Tether doesn't make casual investments.*

---

**INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Lava Network Partners with Google Cloud** | October 2025
The Israeli-founded decentralized RPC protocol joined Google Cloud for the "Autonomous Economy" initiative focused on AI agents, stablecoins, and resilient infrastructure. Lava has served 140 billion relays across 50+ chains.
→ *NOTALONE Take: The AI x Crypto intersection is heating up. Israeli infrastructure plays like Lava are positioning for the agentic economy.*

---

**TALENT**

**StarkWare Alumni Movements**
Multiple reports of senior engineers leaving StarkWare to found new projects. Historical pattern: StarkWare's 2022-2023 restructuring produced several fundable teams.
→ *NOTALONE Take: We're tracking 3 teams with StarkWare DNA. Expect announcements Q1 2026.*

---

**REGULATORY**

**Bank of Israel Digital Shekel Update**
Project Shaked continues technical exploration. No launch date announced, but collaboration with BIS Innovation Hub suggests accelerating timeline.
→ *NOTALONE Take: Regulatory clarity in Israel trails EU (MiCAR) but leads most of MENA. Watch for 2026 framework developments.*

---

**ANALYST NOTE:**

> "The pattern is consistent: Israeli companies don't build consumer DeFi applications—they build the infrastructure layer that consumer applications depend on. Custody, security, data infrastructure, risk management. This is where the Unit 8200 training translates directly.
>
> When Coinbase needs MPC cryptography, they acquire an Israeli company (Unbound). When PayPal needs wallet security, they acquire an Israeli company (Curv). When protocols need risk management, they hire Israeli companies (Chaos Labs for Aave/dYdX).
>
> The playbook is clear. The pipeline is deep. The question isn't whether Israeli crypto infrastructure will continue to be acquired—it's which companies are next."

## Companies We're Watching

### Israeli Crypto/AI on Our Radar

**Lava Network** | Infrastructure

Lava's October partnership with Google Cloud marked a significant validation milestone. The "Autonomous Economy" initiative—focused on AI agents and decentralized data access—positions Lava at the center of the emerging AI x Crypto convergence.

| Stage | Status | Milestone |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Series A Ready | Active Monitoring | 140B+ relays served |

*Decentralized RPC infrastructure is becoming essential as AI agents need reliable blockchain data access. Lava's Google partnership signals institutional validation.*

---

**Zengo** | Security/Consumer

Tether's strategic investment adds another institutional validator to Zengo's cap table. Zero successful hacks since 2018 remains the headline—in an industry that lost $500M+ to exploits in 2024 alone.

| Stage | Status | Milestone |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Strategic Round | Active Monitoring | Tether investment |

*The MPC wallet thesis we explored in this issue's featured story plays out here too. Consumer-grade security with institutional-grade technology.*

### The Next Generation After 8200

*This month's featured story covered Unit 8200 and Talpiot in depth. Here's the follow-on question: what comes next?*

The military-to-startup pipeline produces founders in their early-to-mid twenties with elite training. But the most interesting pattern is what happens in their *second* company.

**The "Second Founder" Effect:**

Israeli founders who exit their first company tend to build bigger the second time. The pattern:

| First Exit | Second Company | Outcome |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| ICQ → AOL ($400M) | Waze → Google ($1.1B) | 2.75x larger |
| Trusteer → IBM ($1B) | Cycode → ??? | Currently $250M+ valuation |
| Wix (IPO) | Multiple AI cos | Several unicorn valuations |

**Why This Matters:**

When we evaluate Israeli founders, we're not just looking at military credentials. We're tracking second-time founders whose first exits validated their capabilities and whose networks have deepened.

The Fordefi team's next project will be one to watch. Pantera knows this—which is why they invested in both Fordefi *and* Paxos.

## Forward Look

### What We're Watching

**The Big Question:**

If AI agents need blockchain infrastructure for payments and data access—and they do—which Israeli companies are positioned to capture that demand?

Lava's Google Cloud partnership is one answer. But the AI x Crypto intersection is the investment theme we expect to define 2025. Israeli companies have the cryptography expertise, the infrastructure building experience, and the security-first mindset that AI agent infrastructure will require.

We're actively sourcing in this category. If you know founders building at this intersection, reply to this email.

**Next Month:**

Issue #002 will feature the ZK/privacy landscape—why zero-knowledge proofs were invented in Israel, and which companies are building on that foundation.
