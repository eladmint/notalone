# NOTALONE: The Crypto Growth Fund

**Building value, not just backing it.**

---

## The Problem We Solve

Every cycle, the same pattern repeats:

Projects raise capital. They launch tokens. They hire. They build.

Then they stall.

Not because the technology failed. Not because the team gave up. But because **growth is a different skill than building** - and most crypto projects don't have it.

They have treasuries full of tokens but no adoption. They have working products but no users. They have vision but no path to scale.

Meanwhile, investors sit on positions hoping the market will do the work for them.

We believe there's a better way.

## What NOTALONE Is

NOTALONE is a **crypto growth fund** - not a venture fund.

We don't bet on ideas and hope they work. We invest in **post-TGE tokens at OTC discount** and deploy our ecosystem-building capabilities to drive adoption and value.

The difference:

| Traditional Crypto VC | NOTALONE Growth Fund |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Invest early, hope it works | Invest post-launch, make it work |
| Capital + advice | Capital + execution |
| Returns from market timing | Returns from growth delivery |
| Passive after investment | Active from day one |

**Our thesis is simple:** The best returns come not from picking winners, but from *creating* them.

## How It Works

### The Model

```
Services Business (Profitable)
        ↓
Generates deal flow + ecosystem expertise
        ↓
Fund invests in projects that need growth
        ↓
Services team deploys to drive adoption
        ↓
Token value appreciation = Fund returns
```

We're not a fund that happens to have a services team. We're an **ecosystem company with an aligned investment arm**.

Services is our business. The fund is how we invest in our best potential clients.

### The Investment Strategy

**80% Liquid Alpha (OTC)**
- Post-TGE tokens purchased at 25-50%+ discount
- Active growth deployment to unlock value
- Hedged positions with VWAP strategies
- 0-12 month typical vesting

**20% Venture**
- Pre-TGE positions in projects we'll support post-launch
- Full-stack value-add from day one
- Pipeline for future OTC opportunities

## Fund Terms

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Target Size** | $100M |
| **Fund Duration** | 3 years |
| **Management Fee** | 0% |
| **Carried Interest** | 20% |
| **Structure** | BVI |

### Why 0% Management Fee?

Because we don't need it. Services is our business.

The fund is aligned with LP returns, not fee extraction. We only make money when you make money.

### Why 3 Years?

Because crypto edges aren't decade-long. The fund is built for the cycle:
- Deployment: 2026-2027
- Growth execution: 2027-2028
- Exit optimization: 2028-2029

Three years of focused execution beats ten years of passive holding.
