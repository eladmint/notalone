## Overview

Notalone is a next-generation venture platform that connects crypto/AI investors, founders, and protocols so everyone benefits when projects grow. We combine a Liquid Fund for OTC opportunities with a Venture Fund for early-stage investments, all governed by milestone-based capital deployment and deal-by-deal transparency.

**What makes us different:**

- **0% Management Fees** - We only profit when you profit
- **Dual Fund Structure** - Liquid Fund (80%) + Venture Fund (20%)
- **Milestone-Based Funding** - Capital released in tranches as founders deliver
- **Deal-by-Deal Transparency** - No blind pools; LPs choose their investments
- **Global Reach** - Network spanning 30+ countries

## The Problem

### The Statistics Tell the Story

| Statistic | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **90%** | of Web3 deals fail to deliver meaningful returns |
| **88%** | of tokens collapse |
| **75%** | of GameFi projects inactive |
| **60%** | fail between pre-seed and Series A |
| **10%** | survive five years |

### Traditional VC is Broken

**Blind Pools = Blind Bets**
68% of institutional LPs cite lack of transparency as their #1 concern.

**Misaligned Incentives**
Managers get paid on AUM, not outcomes. The 2% management fee creates perverse incentives to gather assets rather than generate returns.

**Underperformance**
Median crypto VC fund underperformed BTC and ETH last cycle.

### Pain Points by Stakeholder

**For Angels/LPs:**
- 70-90% of investments fail to build; only 1-2% give decent returns
- Small fund sizes limit access to quality deals
- Very little say in which deals get funded
- Total loss risk when capital goes directly to projects

**For Projects:**
- At mercy of fund managers for deal terms
- Must run to different vendors for tech, marketing, listing, community
- Good projects with potential often forced into harmful deals

**For Ecosystems:**
- Dependent on fund managers for ecosystem fund setup
- Must provide their own capital
- Limited deal flow due to bandwidth constraints

## Our Solution

### Why Notalone Wins

| Traditional VCs | NOTALONE |
|-----------------|----------|
| ~2% management fees annually | **0% management fees** |
| 3-4 year capital lockup | **No lockup on invested capital** |
| Blind pool commitments | **Deal-by-deal discretion** |
| Broad "spray-and-pray" approach | **Active value creation** |
| Limited portfolio visibility | **Real-time dashboards** |
| Minimal post-investment support | **End-to-end support** |

### Core Innovations

1. **0% Management Fees**
   LP capital works harder - compensation tied 100% to results.

2. **LP First, Always**
   Deal-by-deal discretion and voting. Complete freedom to choose your investments, with ability to withdraw profits and unused capital at any time.

3. **Skin in the Game**
   Every GP co-invests personal capital in each deal.

4. **Milestone-Based Discipline**
   Capital released in tranches only when founders deliver - protecting downside risk.

5. **Proprietary Global Deal Flow**
   Pipeline spanning 1,000+ funds, accelerators, and founders across 30+ countries.
