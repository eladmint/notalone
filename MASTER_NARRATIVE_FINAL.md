## The Problem

### The Statistics

| **Statistic** | **Reality** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **90%** | of Web3 deals fail to deliver meaningful returns |
| **88%** | of tokens collapse |
| **75%** | of GameFi projects inactive |
| **60%** | fail between pre-seed and Series A |
| **10%** | survive five years |

*(Source: LP deck page 3)*

### Traditional VC Problems

**Blind Pools = Blind Bets**
In PitchBook's 2024 survey, 68% of institutional LPs cited lack of transparency as their #1 concern.
*(Source: LP deck page 4)*

**Incentives are Misaligned**
Managers get paid on AUM, not outcomes.
*(Source: LP deck page 4)*

**Performance Lags**
Median crypto VC fund underperformed BTC and ETH last cycle.

### Pain Points by Stakeholder

#### Angels/LPs
- Most don't make real money. 70-90% of investments fail to build. 5-9% launch. Only 1-2% give decent returns. Net: hardly any money. But fund managers make money via management fees.
- Small fund sizes = no access to liquid investments or better venture deals (Pre-ICO)
- Deal flow limited to small network of fund managers
- Investors/LPs have very little say in which deals are invested
- For VC deals: All money sent to projects directly and immediately = total loss if failure
- Very little control on project success

#### Projects
- At mercy of fund managers and their cabal for deal terms
- Post investment, supply is decentralized where funds can decide fate of your chart
- Must run to different vendors for different services (tech, investments, marketing, listing, community building)
- To succeed fast, end up doing deals that kill their tokens and eventually the project
- Good projects with huge potential and don't want to get played don't have many options

#### Ecosystems
- Dependent on fund managers to decide if they want to set up ecosystem fund
- Ecosystems have to provide their own money to set up ecosystem fund with VCs
- Community of ecosystem has hardly any say in ecosystem fund
- High-quality dealflow limited due to team bandwidth and limited presence in regions
- Existing ecosystem projects fail to scale due to lack of expert support and funding beyond grants

#### Service Providers
- **Gated Access / Picking 1,000 Locked Doors:** Getting to right decision maker is real pain. Navigating internal politics is impossible. Spend 6-12++ months to close deal with little/no feedback loop.
- **Projects Discovery Limits:** You only know who you know. Expanding network is time expensive. You might have best service but need to pitch from 0 every time. Keeping up and vetting influx of new builders is demanding.
- Getting in on new meta early is like marrying on blind date. You commit based on recommendation with limited data points, driven by potential returns putting reputation at risk.

## Market Opportunity: Why Now?

### 7 Convergent Trends

| Trend | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Market Reset = Clean Slate** | Legacy VC model exposed — LPs demand new structures |
| **Liquidity Cycle Turning - Easing Has Begun** | U.S. rates cut already; ECB has cut multiple times. More easing likely in the next 6-9 months. |
| **LP Mindset Shift** | LPs demand optionality and transparency as a standard - not optional extras. |
| **Bear-Market Valuation Window** | Venture deals are expected to price at true bear-market valuations — an optimal entry point. |
| **Record Dry Powder** | Over $20B raised by crypto funds in 2021–23 is still sitting on the sidelines. |
| **Deployment Lag** | Many funds slowed deployment during the downturn, creating a significant backlog of capital. |
| **Timing Mismatch** | Funds raised at peak valuations must now deploy at bear-market discounts. |

## The NOTALONE Solution

### Why NOTALONE Wins for LPs

**0% Management Fees**
LP capital works harder - compensation tied 100% to results.
*(Source: LP deck page 10)*

**LP First, Always**
Deal-by-deal discretion and voting - no blind pools, no forced allocations. Complete freedom to choose your own investment model, with the ability to withdraw profits and unused capital at any time.
*(Source: LP deck page 10)*

**Skin in the Game**
Every GP co-invests personal capital in each deal. We make money only when our LP's make money.
*(Source: LP deck page 10)*

**Milestone-Based Discipline**
Capital released in tranches only when founders deliver — protecting downside of venture deals.
*(Source: LP deck page 10)*

**Maximizing Portfolio Success**
Support on token design, liquidity, GTM execution, and access to our LP/BD network — powered by regional partners across 20+ countries.
*(Source: LP deck page 10)*

**Proprietary Global Deal Flow**
Pipeline spanning 1,000+ funds, accelerators, and founders — securing opportunities before they hit the open market.

### Traditional VCs vs NOTALONE

| Parameter | Traditional VCs | NOTALONE |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Management Fee** | ~2% annually (irrespective of performance) | 0% (performance-driven, no management fees) |
| **Performance Fee (Carry)** | 20-30% of profits (subject to high-water mark) | 10-20% token-based carry (long-term aligned) |
| **Capital Lockup** | 3-4 years typical | No lockup on invested capital |
| **Capital Oversight** | Centralized, managed solely by fund GP | Self-directed by LPs or managed by NOTALONE |
| **Deployment Structure** | Blind pool (LPs commit without discretion) | Deal-by-deal discretion (LPs select allocations) |
| **Deployment Approach** | Broad "spray-and-pray" with low value-add | Active value creation: token design, liquidity, GTM, partnerships |
| **Capital Preservation** | Rarely prioritized | Milestone-based capital release (3 stages) |
| **Investment Timing** | Constrained by vintage cycle; pressured to deploy | Fresh capital base; opportunistic deployment at favorable valuations |
| **Portfolio Transparency** | Limited visibility; periodic GP reporting | Real-time dashboards + milestone-based updates |
| **Liquidity / Realization Timeline** | Typically 3-5 years to realize gains | Shorter cycles; realizations upon milestone completion or liquidity events |
| **Deal Sourcing** | Ad-hoc; largely through intermediaries | Direct from ecosystems & NOTALONE's 20+ country network |
| **Post-Investment Support** | Minimal, usually introductions only | End-to-end support: marketing, tech, strategy, BD, partnerships, listings, service provider network |
| **Incentives Alignment** | Misaligned; GP fees tied to AUM, not performance | Aligned; GPs co-invest personal capital alongside LPs |

## Business Model

### How Much Money Will We Make: 20-25 Million by 2028

#### From LPs - 21 million by 2028

1. Staking/liquidity provides initial 10% commitment in stables:
   - 10% of 100 Million = 10 million @ 4% APY = 400k per year

2. 10 million we expect to be given to us directly by LPs who want us to manage the money:
   - This will be another 400k per year

3. We expect overall 2x returns on 100 million:
   - If we take 20% of that as profit = 20 million for us by 2028

4. For every deal brought in, the proposer gets 2% of the total invested amount:
   - If we only get 25% of all deals to the investors directly, we will get 2% of 25 million = 500k

#### From Service Providers - 500k

- We will be able to provide at least a service of 5% of our total investment via service providers = 5 Million
- We will take 10% fees from these service providers = 500k by 2028

#### From Ecosystems - 4 million

- We will be able to give a service of 100k (in terms of adoption activities) per ecosystem
- So if we work with 20 ecosystems by 2028, we will get 2 million from them
- We will be able to get at least 100k in grants from each ecosystem to the project = 2 million in grants
- For this, we will get 2 million worth of tokens from projects
- If we do 10X on 10% of this 2 million, we will get 2 million

### How Much We Spend - 12.5 million

- Team - 1 million /year - 4 million
- Ecosystem services - 1.5 million
- Tech - 500k
- Compliances - 500k
- OPs and Infrastructure - 1 million
- Marketing - 4 million
- Misc - 1 million

### Net Profit: 8 million - 10 million (if we make overall 2X, this is very realistic)

**Claim Module:**
Anyone needing to claim tokens/funding connects wallet. All valid claims can be redeemed. Secondary sale of SHAFT NFT: new wallet with NFT ownership can claim. For investors: platform checks avg price at token release date and deducts 20% of profit if profit exists. For projects: can claim milestone payment once milestone achievement approved by DAO. If project fails milestone, remaining money returned to investors.

**Governance Module:**
Basic module to vote on milestone and listing of projects or changes to T&C or features of platform. Same proposal module. Voting module.
