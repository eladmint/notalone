# &milio - Corrected Blurb (Proper Style)

Below is how the blurb SHOULD look based on your team's actual messaging patterns:

---

&milio | AI-Powered DeFi Automation Platform | Raising $2.5M-$4M SAFE @ $9M pre / $15M cap | Deck | App

&milio is building an AI-native DeFi automation platform - "Autopilot for DeFi" where users set goals and AI agents execute across 100+ protocols, 15+ chains, and 100M+ trading pairs automatically. Backed by Wix Ventures, PrimeVC, and ex-Kraken US CEO.

Solving the DeFi complexity crisis: 420M crypto users, 50M active traders struggling with protocol complexity. User pain validated - 84% report missing opportunities, 76% struggle with portfolio management, 92% want simplified access.

# TRACTION:

User Growth (beta):
- 2,480 WAU (weekly active users)
- 562 DAU (daily active users)
- 52,700 total orders (alpha-to-date)
- 314 Active Auto Traders (≥$1 SOL) in month one

Engagement & Retention:
- 81% retention for Auto Trader users
- 50% daily retention overall

- 50% of Auto Trader users have already topped up

Revenue & Volume:

- $1.3M cumulative volume
- $95K weekly volume (ATH)
- 4,787 weekly orders (+24% WoW growth)
- $120K AUM (user funds on protocol)

# WHY IT WINS

Position: Massive complexity crisis in DeFi. DeFi AI emerging as new $11.1B market cap category. Market opportunity: $84T annual global crypto trading volume, $100B+ DeFi TVL.

Product: AI agents navigate entire DeFi landscape autonomously - users don't need to understand protocols, gas optimization, or timing. Live and working, not vaporware. Strong PMF signals: 81% retention, 30% upgrade rate, 50% top-up rate.

Economics: Token economics designed for value accrual - Buy & Burn (protocol revenue buys and burns tokens), Stake to Participate (required staking for advanced features), Performance Incentives (rewards for strategy sharing).

Team: Moti Cohen (CEO) - Serial entrepreneur, ex-Apester.com founder (multi-million dollar exit), Founding member of Bit.dev, active crypto degen since 2017. Omri Kerel (CTO) - VP of R&D, expertise in cloud engineering, AI engineering, active degen since 2017.
