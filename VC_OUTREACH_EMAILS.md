# NOTALONE: First Email Templates for Israeli VCs

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-30

## Email Template 1: Close Personal Connection (Warm)

**Use When:** You know the VC personally, have invested together before, or have a strong relationship

**Subject Line:** Quick question about syndication

---

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick one - I know you just closed that [sector] deal with [company name]. Mazel tov.

Real talk: how long did it take to fill your syndicate? I'm guessing 6-8 weeks of email tennis to find the right co-investors?

I'm working with a platform called NOTALONE (built by the team that scaled NEAR/ICP globally) that cuts syndication time to <2 weeks. Zero upfront commitment, zero management fees - you just get matched with co-investors who fit your thesis.

Thought of you because:
1. You're doing 3-4 deals/year and always need co-investors
2. You want international VCs for strategic value
3. You don't have time for 2-month syndication processes

Worth a 15-min call to show you how it works? I can walk through the platform + share 2-3 deals from our current pipeline that might fit your thesis.

Or if you prefer, I can just send you a quick Loom (5 min) and you watch on your own time.

Either way, no pressure. Just thought you'd want to see this.

LMK,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're in private beta (10 Israeli VCs only). If you join now, you get 6 months free + priority co-investor matching. After that, only pay when deals close (2-3% syndication fee, no management fees).
```

## Email Template 2: Professional Acquaintance (Medium Warm)

**Use When:** You've met the VC at events, have mutual connections, but haven't worked together directly

**Subject Line:** [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out - syndication tool

---

```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Connection Name] mentioned you're actively investing in [sector] and often syndicate your deals with international VCs.

I'm [Your Name] - we met briefly at [event/context]. I'm now working with NOTALONE, a syndication platform specifically for Israeli VCs.

The problem we solve: syndication takes 3 months. We cut it to <3 weeks by matching you with pre-vetted co-investors (Israeli + international) who fit your thesis.

**No upfront commitment. No management fees. You invest deal-by-deal.**

I'm reaching out because:
- [Mutual Connection] said you're looking for co-investors on your current [sector] deal
- We have 2 US VCs on the platform specifically seeking Israeli [sector] founders
- You'd be a good fit for our private beta (only 10 Israeli VCs, free for 6 months)

Would you be open to a quick 15-min demo? I can show you:
1. How the platform works (super simple, not another complex tool)
2. Current deal pipeline (20+ Israeli startups, all curated)
3. Co-investor matching (I'll show you 2-3 VCs who would co-invest with you based on your thesis)

If you're too busy for a call, I'm happy to send a 5-min Loom instead.

Let me know what works.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Attaching a 1-pager on how NOTALONE works. TL;DR: We're syndication infrastructure, not another funding platform. You keep full control, we just make it faster.
```

## Email Template 3: Cold-ish (1-Degree Away, Warm Intro)

**Use When:** You don't know the VC directly but have a mutual connection who can intro you

**Subject Line:** [Mutual Connection] intro - Israeli VC syndication

---

```
Hi [First Name],

[Mutual Connection] connected us - hope that's okay.

Quick context: I work with NOTALONE, a syndication platform for Israeli VCs. We're launching private beta (10 VCs only) and [Mutual Connection] thought you'd be a good fit.

**What we do:**
Help Israeli VCs syndicate deals faster (3 months → 3 weeks) by matching them with pre-vetted co-investors. No upfront commitment, no management fees.

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
1. [Mutual Connection] said you're active in [sector]
2. You syndicate most of your deals (need 2-4 co-investors per round)
3. You want international co-investors for strategic value

**What I'm offering:**
- 15-min demo (I'll show you the platform + current deal pipeline)
- Free beta access for 6 months
- Manual intro to 1 relevant deal in your thesis (so you can see value before committing to platform)

**What I'm asking:**
Just your feedback. If it's useful, great. If not, no worries - I'll take your input to improve the platform.

Sound fair?

If you're interested, here's my Calendly: [link]
Or just reply with a time that works, and I'll send a Zoom.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

---

P.S. - [Mutual Connection] mentioned you passed on a deal recently because you couldn't syndicate fast enough. That's exactly the problem we solve. Happy to start there.
```

---

## Email Template 4: Very Direct / Founder-Style (Israeli Tone)

**Use When:** You know the VC appreciates direct, no-BS communication (common in Israeli ecosystem)

**Subject Line:** Syndication sucks. Let's fix it.

---

```
[First Name],

Syndication is broken. You know it, I know it.

You find a great Unit 8200 founder building the next Fireblocks. You want to lead the round. But you need 3 co-investors.

So you spend 8 weeks:
- Emailing VCs who don't respond
- Chasing intros through mutual connections
- Coordinating conflicting terms
- Watching the founder get impatient

Meanwhile, the deal goes cold or another VC swoops in.

**NOTALONE fixes this:**
Post your deal → Get matched with co-investors in 48 hours → Close in 2-3 weeks.

No upfront commitment. No management fees. You invest when YOU find the right deal.

**I'm not asking you to trust the platform yet. I'm asking you to try ONE deal.**

Reply with:
1. Your thesis (sector, stage, check size)
2. One deal you passed on recently (so I know what NOT to send)

I'll intro you to a relevant founder from our pipeline within 24 hours. If it's valuable, we talk about the platform. If not, I'll leave you alone.

Deal?

[Your Name]

P.S. - We're built by the team that scaled NEAR/ICP ecosystems globally (10K+ devs trained, 300+ projects launched). We know how to move fast.
```

---

## Email Template 5: Follow-Up After No Response (1 Week Later)

**Use When:** VC didn't respond to first email (happens a lot, don't take it personally)

**Subject Line:** Re: Quick question about syndication

---

```
[First Name],

Following up on my email from last week (below).

I get it - you're busy. So let me make this even simpler:

**I'll send you 1 relevant deal from our pipeline.** No demo, no platform, just a warm intro to a founder who fits your thesis.

If it's valuable → we talk about NOTALONE.
If it's not → I won't bother you again.

**Just reply with your current thesis** (sector, stage, check size) and I'll send something within 24 hours.

That's it. No strings attached.

[Your Name]

---

P.S. - We just helped [Beta VC Name] syndicate a $5M round in 3 weeks (vs. their usual 2-3 months). Happy to intro you if you want to hear directly from them.
```

---

## Email Template 6: Follow-Up After Demo (Next Steps)

**Use When:** You've done a demo call and want to close the VC on joining beta

**Subject Line:** Next steps - NOTALONE beta access

---

```
[First Name],

Good talking yesterday. Thanks for the feedback on [specific feedback they gave].

**Quick recap of what we discussed:**
- You're looking for [sector] deals, Series A/B, $100K-$500K checks
- You syndicate 3-4 deals/year, usually takes 2-3 months
- You want international co-investors (especially US VCs with acquisition connections)

**Next steps to get you set up:**

1. **Beta Access (Today):**
   I'll send you login credentials to NOTALONE platform. You can browse our current pipeline (20+ deals) and see if anything fits your thesis.

2. **Co-Investor Matching (This Week):**
   I'll manually match you with 2-3 VCs on the platform who co-invest in [sector]. You can reach out directly or I can facilitate intros.

3. **First Deal (Next 2 Weeks):**
   Let's aim to get you into 1 co-investment in the next 2 weeks. That way you see immediate value, not just promises.

**What you need to do:**
1. Confirm you want beta access (just reply "yes")
2. Fill out this 2-min form so I can set up your profile: [link]
3. (Optional) Invite 1-2 other Israeli VCs you trust - we have 3 spots left in beta cohort

**Reminder on terms:**
- Free for 6 months (no fees until Q3 2025)
- After that: 2-3% syndication fee when deals close, OR 20% carry on exits (you choose)
- Zero management fees, zero upfront commitment

Sound good? Reply "yes" and I'll get you set up today.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I'll also send you our Q1 Israeli VC Syndication Report next week (anonymized data on valuations, time-to-close benchmarks). You'll be the first to see it.
```

## Email Template 7: Referral Request (After Successful First Deal)

**Use When:** VC has successfully co-invested through NOTALONE and you want them to refer other VCs

**Subject Line:** Quick favor - who else should join NOTALONE?

---

```
[First Name],

Glad the [Company Name] deal worked out. Mazel tov on closing in [X weeks] - way faster than your usual timeline.

**Quick favor:**

We have 5 spots left in our private beta for Israeli VCs. Who else in your network should I invite?

I'm looking for VCs who:
- Actively syndicate deals (3+ deals/year)
- Want faster co-investor matching
- Appreciate direct, no-BS tools (not enterprise software bloat)

Anyone come to mind? Just reply with names + intros (or I can reach out cold with your name as reference).

**Why this matters to you:**
The more Israeli VCs on the platform, the easier YOUR syndications become. Network effects work in your favor.

**Referral incentive:**
For every VC you refer who joins:
- You get 24-hour early access to all new deals (before other VCs see them)
- Free premium features (portfolio tracking, advanced analytics)
- Co-branding on case studies (if you want PR)

Let me know who I should talk to.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If you don't have specific names, just forward this email to your VC group chat / WhatsApp. I'm happy to field inbound.
```

## Email Template 8: Re-Engagement (VC Went Inactive)

**Use When:** VC joined platform but hasn't logged in for 4+ weeks

**Subject Line:** Still relevant? (NOTALONE check-in)

---

```
[First Name],

Haven't seen you on NOTALONE in a few weeks. Just checking in - is the platform still useful or did we miss the mark?

**Honest feedback appreciated:**
- Not seeing relevant deal flow? (Tell me your thesis again, I'll curate better)
- Too busy to check platform? (I can send you weekly digests instead)
- Found co-investors another way? (All good, just let me know so I stop bothering you)

**If you're still interested but haven't found the right deal yet:**

We have 3 new [sector] deals that just came in:
1. [Company A] - Unit 8200 founder, cybersecurity, raising $3M Series A
2. [Company B] - Weizmann spinout, ZK infrastructure, raising $2M Seed
3. [Company C] - Repeat founder (prev exit to PayPal), DeFi protocol, raising $5M Series A

Want intros to any of these? Just reply with which one(s) and I'll connect you directly (no need to log into platform).

Let me know how I can make this more useful for you.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If NOTALONE isn't the right fit, no hard feelings. Just want to make sure I'm not wasting your time.
```

## Email Sequences (Recommended Cadence)

### Sequence A: Cold to Warm

**Day 1:** Email Template 3 (Cold-ish intro)
**Day 8:** Email Template 5 (Follow-up if no response)
**Day 15:** Give up OR try different angle (LinkedIn message, mutual connection call)

---

### Sequence B: Demo to Close

**After Demo:** Email Template 6 (Next steps)
**Day 3 (if no response):** WhatsApp: "Hey, still interested? Just need you to confirm beta access."
**Day 7 (if still no response):** Email: "No worries if timing isn't right. Want me to check back in a month?"

---

### Sequence C: Active User to Advocate

**After 1 successful deal:** Personal call or WhatsApp: "That worked well, right? Who else should I invite?"
**Week 2:** Email Template 7 (Referral request)
**Month 2:** Check in: "You've done 2 deals through NOTALONE. Want to do a case study? Would be great PR for you."

---

## Pro Tips

### Use WhatsApp for Israeli VCs
- Email is slow in Israel
- WhatsApp = faster response rate
- Send email for details, WhatsApp for "hey, did you see my email?"

### Personalize Every Email
- Reference specific deals they've done
- Mention mutual connections by name
- Show you've done research (their portfolio, recent tweets)

### Follow Up Aggressively (But Not Annoyingly)
- Israeli VCs are busy, don't take silence personally
- 2-3 follow-ups is normal
- But after 3, move on

### Video Intros Work Well
- Record a 2-min Loom walking through platform
- Personalize it: "Hey [Name], here's how NOTALONE works, specifically for [their thesis]"
- Send Loom link in email

### Test Subject Lines
- Israeli VCs respond to directness
- "Syndication sucks" often gets higher open rate than "Introducing NOTALONE Platform"

---

## Tools & Resources

### Email Tracking
- Use Streak or Mixmax to track opens/clicks
- If VC opens email 3 times but doesn't respond = send follow-up

### Scheduling
- Calendly link in every email (make it frictionless to book)
- Offer specific times ("Tuesday 2pm or Thursday 10am?") if they don't use Calendly

### Templates in Gmail
- Save these as Gmail templates (Canned Responses)
- Personalize the [bracketed sections] for each VC

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose 10 VCs from your network map**
2. **Categorize by relationship strength** (warm, medium, cold)
3. **Pick appropriate email template** for each
4. **Personalize every email** (don't copy-paste blindly)
5. **Send 2-3 emails per day** (don't blast all 10 at once)
6. **Track responses** (spreadsheet or CRM)
7. **Follow up after 1 week** if no response

---

**Remember:** Your personal credibility is the product in Phase 1. The platform is just infrastructure. Lead with relationships, not technology.
