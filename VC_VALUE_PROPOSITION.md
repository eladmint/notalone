# What NOTALONE Offers Israeli VCs

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-30

---

## The One-Line Pitch

**NOTALONE helps Israeli VCs syndicate deals faster and access better deal flow—without upfront capital commitments.**

---

## The Problem You Face

### Syndication Takes Too Long
- Finding 2-4 co-investors for a deal takes **3-6 months** of email tennis
- You waste time on intros that don't convert
- Miss deals because you can't syndicate fast enough
- Founders pressure you to close quickly or they move on

### Deal Flow Overwhelm
- 100+ decks per month, 95% not relevant
- Hard to filter for quality (Unit 8200, academic pedigree, etc.)
- Miss deals because they don't reach your network
- No efficient way to see what your peers are looking at

### Cross-Border Co-Investment is Hard
- You want international co-investors (strategic value, exit connections)
- But you don't have warm intros to US/EU VCs
- Building those relationships takes years
- Founders want global syndicate, not just Israeli VCs

### Capital Deployment Pressure
- LPs want faster deployment
- But you can't commit to funds with management fees when you're selective
- Deal-by-deal makes sense but requires more effort to syndicate

---

## What NOTALONE Does For You

### 1. **Faster Syndication** (Main Value Proposition)

**The Problem:**
You lead a $5M round for a cybersecurity startup. You need 3 co-investors to fill the round. Traditionally, this takes 3 months.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **48-hour co-investor matching:** Post your deal to trusted network
- **Pre-vetted co-investors:** VCs filtered by sector, stage, check size
- **Warm intro paths:** See how you're connected (mutual contacts)
- **Real-time commitment tracking:** Know who's in, who's still deciding
- **One-click deal sharing:** Send to your existing co-investors instantly

**Result:** Syndicate rounds in **2-4 weeks instead of 3 months**.

---

### 2. **Curated Deal Flow Access**

**The Problem:**
You see 100 decks/month, but only 2-3 are relevant to your thesis.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **Specialized filters:**
  - Founder background (Unit 8200, Matzov, Weizmann, Technion)
  - Sector (Cybersecurity, Infrastructure, DeFi, B2B SaaS)
  - Stage (Seed, Series A/B)
  - Geography (Israel-founded, relocating, etc.)
- **Social proof signals:**
  - Other VCs already reviewing
  - Mutual connections to founders
  - Previous exits/companies
- **Quality scoring:**
  - Technical credibility (GitHub activity, research papers)
  - Traction metrics (revenue, users, partnerships)
  - Team pedigree (elite military units, academic backgrounds)

**Result:** See only **high-signal deals** that fit your thesis.

---

### 3. **Cross-Border Co-Investor Matching**

**The Problem:**
Your portfolio company needs a US strategic investor for future exit. You don't have warm intros to Coinbase Ventures, a16z crypto, etc.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **International VC network:**
  - US/EU VCs specifically seeking Israeli deal flow
  - Corporate VCs (PayPal Ventures, Coinbase Ventures)
  - Funds with Israeli LP connections
- **Co-investment matching:**
  - You lead (local expertise, on-ground support)
  - International VC co-invests (strategic value, exit connections)
  - Shared diligence, faster close
- **Warm intro facilitation:**
  - NOTALONE provides intro path
  - Your co-investment is the warm intro

**Result:** Build **global syndicates** that add strategic value beyond capital.

---

### 4. **No Upfront Capital Commitment**

**The Problem:**
Traditional platforms require fund commitments with management fees. You want deal-by-deal flexibility.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **Zero management fees:** No cost to access platform
- **Zero commitment until you invest:** Browse deals, no pressure
- **Invest only in deals you choose:** Full autonomy
- **Performance-aligned fees:** NOTALONE only earns when you profit (20% on gains)

**Result:** **Full flexibility** to deploy capital on your terms.

---

### 5. **Trust-Based Network**

**The Problem:**
Cold deal flow is risky. You invest based on relationships and warm intros.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **Network proximity visualization:**
  - See how you're connected to every founder (1-2 degrees)
  - View mutual connections (other VCs, entrepreneurs, academics)
- **Verified credentials:**
  - Military unit background (Unit 8200, Matzov)
  - Academic affiliations (Weizmann, Technion, Stanford)
  - Previous companies/exits
- **Reputation system:**
  - Founder track record (previous funding, delivery on milestones)
  - VC track record (co-investment history, portfolio companies)

**Result:** **Invest with confidence** based on verified trust signals.

---

### 6. **Co-Investment Intelligence**

**The Problem:**
You don't know what other VCs are looking at or co-investing in.

**The NOTALONE Solution:**
- **Deal momentum visibility:**
  - See which deals other VCs are reviewing
  - Track commitments in real-time
  - Identify hot deals before they close
- **Co-investor discovery:**
  - "VCs like you also invested in..." (similar thesis matching)
  - Find new co-investors based on past syndications
- **Anonymous market data:**
  - Average valuations by sector/stage
  - Typical syndicate composition (how many co-investors)
  - Time-to-close benchmarks

**Result:** **Better investment decisions** based on market intelligence.

**Step 5: Close Deal (Off-Platform or On-Platform)**

- Handle legal/wiring off-platform (your choice)

**Time Saved:** 2-3 months → 2-4 weeks

- Your net = $1.05M (4.2x return)

## FAQ for VCs

### "Why should I trust NOTALONE?"

**Answer:**
You shouldn't trust the platform initially—you should trust [Your Name]. I've been in the Israeli ecosystem for [X years], and I'm putting my reputation behind this. Every founder I introduce you to, I've vetted personally.

NOTALONE is just infrastructure. The trust comes from our shared network.

**Proof:** Start with 1 deal. If it's not valuable, don't use it again.

---

### "What if I don't want to share my deal flow?"

**Answer:**
You don't have to. NOTALONE has two modes:

1. **Private Mode:** Only VCs you invite can see your deals
2. **Public Mode:** Open to all NOTALONE VCs (but you control who gets access to diligence materials)

Most VCs start with private mode (just their existing co-investors), then expand once they see value.

---

### "How do you prevent deal theft?"

**Answer:**
- **NDAs:** Founders can require NDAs before sharing sensitive materials
- **Access controls:** You approve who sees full diligence (pitch deck is public, financials/customer data are private)
- **Reputation system:** VCs who break trust get removed from platform
- **Israeli ecosystem dynamics:** Deal theft kills your reputation permanently (everyone knows everyone)

---

### "Do I have to use NOTALONE's legal docs?"

**Answer:**
No. You can use NOTALONE for:
- Just deal flow (browse deals, no syndication)
- Just deal room (coordinate with your existing co-investors)
- Just co-investor matching (we introduce, you handle legal offline)

You only pay fees if we help close the deal with new co-investors.

---

### "What if I want to co-invest in a deal I found outside NOTALONE?"

**Answer:**
That's fine. You can invite other VCs to co-invest through NOTALONE platform (deal room, coordination tools) even if you sourced the deal yourself.

**No fees if you sourced it.** We only charge when we help with syndication/co-investor matching.

---

### "How does NOTALONE make money if there are no management fees?"

**Answer:**
Three ways:

1. **Syndication fees (VCs leading deals):** 2-3% of capital raised when we help syndicate
2. **Performance fees (VCs co-investing):** 20% on gains at exit
3. **Ecosystem services (separate business):** We provide growth services to portfolio companies (marketing, GTM, partnerships)

We only make money when you make money.

---

### "Can I use NOTALONE just to find co-investors for my existing portfolio companies?"

**Answer:**
Yes. Many VCs use NOTALONE to:
- Help portfolio companies raise follow-on rounds
- Find strategic co-investors for specific needs (US market access, corporate partnerships)
- Syndicate pro-rata rights they can't fully exercise

---

### "What happens if a deal falls through?"

**Answer:**
- **No fees if deal doesn't close**
- **No penalty**
- **You can repost the deal** if terms change

We only charge when capital actually wires and deal closes.

---

### "How do you handle conflicts (multiple VCs competing for allocation)?"

**Answer:**
- **Lead VC decides:** You control allocation to co-investors
- **Founder has final say:** If oversubscribed, founder chooses preferred investors
- **Transparent process:** Everyone sees how much interest there is, no hidden competing bids

## How to Get Started (3 Options)

### Option 1: Demo Call (30 minutes)

- No commitment required

**[Schedule Demo Call](#)**

---

### Option 2: Join Private Beta (Immediate Access)

**[Request Beta Access](#)**

---

### Option 3: Start with One Deal (Manual)
- Don't want to use platform yet? No problem.
- I'll manually introduce you to 1 relevant founder
- If it's valuable, then we talk about platform
- Zero pressure

**[Tell me your thesis, I'll send a relevant deal](#)**

---

## Next Steps

**For most VCs, I recommend Option 3** (start with one manual intro).

Why? Because you don't need to trust the platform—you just need to see if I can introduce you to a relevant deal faster than your current process.

If that works, then the platform becomes useful. If not, no harm done.

**Let's start with one intro. Reply with:**
1. Your investment thesis (sector, stage, check size)
2. One recent deal you passed on (so I know what NOT to send)
3. Ideal founder background (Unit 8200? Academic? Previous exit?)

I'll send you 1-2 relevant deals from our current pipeline within 48 hours.

No platform login required. Just you, me, and a warm intro to a great founder.

Sound fair?
