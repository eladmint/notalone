# analyst Local Context - Notalone

## My Role Here
Infrastructure and data architecture analysis for the Notalone project - Israeli tech ecosystem tracking and LP prospecting.

## My Recent Work
- 2026-01-11: Apache Superset plugin ecosystem analysis
  - Researched custom visualization plugin architecture
  - Identified ECharts Graph Chart as built-in solution for network visualization
  - Analyzed third-party plugins, embedding options, and Docker deployment
  - Mapped to Notalone's network visualization requirements
- 2026-01-11: Comprehensive analysis of Airtable to XNode3 migration decision
  - Audited current Airtable base: 13 tables, 100+ records across People, Companies, Employment History
  - Evaluated relationship complexity and network analysis requirements
  - Produced migration recommendation report

## Patterns I Use Here
- Data volume analysis before infrastructure recommendations
- Cost-benefit analysis with quantified metrics
- Consider both technical and user experience factors
- Evaluate existing ecosystem integrations (NocoDB, Superset on XNode3)

## Project-Specific Knowledge
- Tech stack: Airtable (current), potential PostgreSQL/NocoDB/Superset (XNode3)
- Key tables: People (33+), Companies (28+), Employment History (57+), Institutions (16), Acquisitions (13)
- Network patterns tracked: "8200 Origin", "Check Point Mafia", "Modu Effect"
- XNode3 server: 74.50.97.243 (NixOS, 43GB available)
- Events Hive already running on XNode3 with 9 tables, 7 dashboards, 71 charts

## My Current Focus
- [x] Airtable to XNode3 migration analysis
- [x] Apache Superset plugin ecosystem analysis for network graphs
- [ ] Data migration planning if approved
- [ ] Dashboard design for network visualization
- [ ] Network graph implementation in Superset (ECharts Graph Chart)
