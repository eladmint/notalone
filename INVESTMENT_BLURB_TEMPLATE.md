## FIELD DEFINITIONS & TIPS

### Essential Elements (Always Include)
- **Project Name**: Clear, memorable
- **What They Do**: One sentence max
- **Why It Matters**: Problem/opportunity
- **The Numbers**: At minimum FDV and raise amount
- **Links**: Always include pitch deck at minimum

### Traction Metrics (Pick 3-5 most impressive)
- Volume/Revenue
- Users (total and active)
- Transactions
- Growth rate
- Notable integrations/partnerships
- Social proof (followers, engagement)

### Team Details (When Relevant)
- Previous exits
- Notable companies (ex-Google, ex-Goldman, etc.)
- Domain expertise
- Track record with numbers

### Deal Terms (Be Specific)
- Entry price
- FDV and circulating market cap
- Unlock schedule (% at TGE, cliff, vesting)
- Expected multiple at exit/TGE
- Round status (oversubscribed, filling fast, etc.)

### Tone Guidelines
- **Be concise**: Telegram = mobile reading
- **Lead with numbers**: Traction speaks louder than vision
- **Show momentum**: Growth rates, velocity, "in X weeks"
- **Highlight special access**: "Private round filled", "top KOLs invested"
- **Create urgency** (when appropriate): "Filling fast", "final allocation"

## COMMON PATTERNS TO FOLLOW

1. **Numbers speak**: Every strong blurb leads with specific metrics, not vision
2. **Timeframes matter**: "$15.5M volume in 2 weeks" > "$15.5M volume"
3. **Multiples excite**: Always show entry vs exit multiple when possible
4. **Social proof works**: Notable investors, customers, or KOLs add credibility
5. **Team = execution**: Previous exits and recognizable companies matter
6. **Create FOMO**: "Already filled", "friend invested 100k", oversubscribed signals
