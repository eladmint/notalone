# Zengo - Research Report

**Research Date:** December 8, 2025
**Company Website:** https://zengo.com
**Headquarters:** Tel Aviv, Israel
**Founded:** 2017

## Executive Summary

Zengo is a leading self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that leverages Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to eliminate the traditional seed phrase vulnerability, positioning itself as "the most secure crypto wallet." With over 1.5 million registered users, $52M in total funding (including a recent strategic investment from Tether), and zero successful hacks since launch in 2018, Zengo is building a premium "super app" for digital assets targeting beginners, advanced users, and business teams through its innovative SA-AS (Secured Asset-As-a-Service) business model.

---

## 1. Company Overview

### What They Do

Zengo provides a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet application that allows digital asset owners to:

- Securely store, send, receive, and trade cryptocurrencies without seed phrase vulnerability
- Access premium security features including Web3 firewall, theft protection, legacy transfer, and secured vaults
- Connect to decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols with built-in transaction protection
- Buy/sell crypto through integrated on/off-ramps with multiple payment options
- Manage digital assets across multiple blockchains through a single, user-friendly interface

### The Problem They Solve

**The seed phrase problem is fundamentally broken**:

1. **Massive Security Losses**: Over $100 billion+ lost over the past decade through lack of security, human errors, scams, SIM swaps, and social engineering attacks
2. **Complexity and User Error**: Traditional wallets force users to manage 12-24 word seed phrases, creating single points of failure that lead to permanent loss of funds
3. **Scalability Issues**: Seed phrase-based wallets cannot efficiently scale to serve advanced users and business teams without costly add-ons, resulting in fragile business models with limited lifetime value per user

**Zengo solves this through MPC technology**, which eliminates the single point of failure by distributing key management between the user's device and Zengo's servers, ensuring neither party alone can access funds while maintaining true self-custody.

## 5. Technology

### Core Technology Approach

Zengo's MPC (Multi-Party Computation) architecture represents a fundamental advancement in wallet security:

1. **Threshold Cryptography**: Private keys are never created or stored in a single location. Instead, two "secret shares" are created independently - one on the user's device (Personal Share) and one on Zengo's servers (Remote Share)
2. **Distributed Signing**: Transactions require both shares to compute a signature, ensuring neither party can unilaterally access funds
3. **Zero Single Point of Failure**: Unlike seed phrases, there's no single piece of information that can be lost, stolen, or compromised to lose access to funds

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Security Model**: MPC-based threshold cryptography
- **Authentication**: 3-Factor Authentication (3FA) with biometric encryption
- **Recovery System**: Guaranteed recovery without seed phrases using face mapping and backup devices
- **Patents**: 4 US-registered MPC patents + 1 EU-registered patent
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Desktop (launched November 2024)

### Technology Stack (Known Components)

- Open-source MPC implementation (recently published)
- Multi-chain blockchain integrations (120+ assets supported)
- Biometric authentication systems
- Real-time Web3 firewall for transaction screening

The crypto wallet market is highly fragmented with different players dominating specific niches (MetaMask for DeFi, Ledger for cold storage, Phantom for Solana). Most competitors rely on vulnerable seed phrase architecture. Zengo's differentiation lies in bringing institutional-grade MPC security to retail users while building a sustainable premium business model. The company positions itself as the "primary super app" where users consolidate assets across all chains, rather than a chain-specific or use-case-specific wallet.

- **Regulatory Unknowns**: MTL licensing needs and global regulatory landscape in flux
- **Series B Timing**: Raising in uncertain crypto market environment

### Discrepancies Between Sources

- **User Count**: PDF memo (Jan 2024) states 1.1M users; web sources (Feb 2025) cite 1.5M+ users - consistent growth trajectory
- **Funding Total**: PDF mentions raising $15M Series B; Tracxn shows $52M total raised including undisclosed Tether investment
- **Pro Subscribers**: PDF states 4,000+ paid subs (early 2024); likely higher now but current figure not found

### Next Steps

- [ ] Request current metrics update (users, AUM, ARR, subscriber count as of Dec 2025)
- [ ] Understand Series B round status and current valuation expectations
- [ ] Evaluate Zengo Teams traction and customer pipeline
- [ ] Review competitive analysis on emerging MPC wallet solutions
- [ ] Assess regulatory strategy and MTL licensing timeline
