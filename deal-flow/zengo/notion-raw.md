## Company Overview 
---
### **What they do**
Zengo provides a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet application that allows digital asset owners to:
- Securely store, send, receive, and trade cryptocurrencies without seed phrase vulnerability
- Access premium security features including Web3 firewall, theft protection, legacy transfer, and secured vaults
- Connect to decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols with built-in transaction protection
- Buy/sell crypto through integrated on/off-ramps with multiple payment options
- Manage digital assets across multiple blockchains through a single, user-friendly interface
### **The Problem They Solve**
**The seed phrase problem is fundamentally broken**:
1. **Massive Security Losses**: Over $100 billion+ lost over the past decade through lack of security, human errors, scams, SIM swaps, and social engineering attacks
1. **Complexity and User Error**: Traditional wallets force users to manage 12-24 word seed phrases, creating single points of failure that lead to permanent loss of funds
1. **Scalability Issues**: Seed phrase-based wallets cannot efficiently scale to serve advanced users and business teams without costly add-ons, resulting in fragile business models with limited lifetime value per user
**Zengo solves this through MPC technology**, which eliminates the single point of failure by distributing key management between the user's device and Zengo's servers, ensuring neither party alone can access funds while maintaining true self-custody.

## **Technology**
---
### **Core Technology Approach**
Zengo's MPC architecture represents a fundamental advancement in wallet security:
1. **Threshold Cryptography**: Private keys are never created or stored in a single location. Instead, two "secret shares" are created independently - one on the user's device (Personal Share) and one on Zengo's servers (Remote Share)
1. **Distributed Signing**: Transactions require both shares to compute a signature, ensuring neither party can unilaterally access funds
1. **Zero Single Point of Failure**: Unlike seed phrases, there's no single piece of information that can be lost, stolen, or compromised to lose access to funds
### **Technical Infrastructure**
- **Security Model**: MPC-based threshold cryptography
- **Authentication**: 3-Factor Authentication (3FA) with biometric encryption
- **Recovery System**: Guaranteed recovery without seed phrases using face mapping and backup devices
- **Patents**: 4 US-registered MPC patents + 1 EU-registered patent
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Desktop (launched November 2024)
### **Technology Stack (Known Components)**
- Open-source MPC implementation (recently published)
- Multi-chain blockchain integrations (120+ assets supported)
- Biometric authentication systems
- Real-time Web3 firewall for transaction screening

  - **Focus**: Browser-based wallet for Ethereum/EVM chains, dominant in DeFi
  - **Users**: 30+ million monthly active users
  - **Funding**: Part of ConsenSys ($725M raised)
  - **Differentiator**: Ecosystem dominance, browser extension model, deep DeFi integration
  - **Weakness vs Zengo**: Seed phrase vulnerability, limited mobile experience, narrower chain support
- **Ledger**
  - **Focus**: Hardware wallet for cold storage
  - **Market Position**: Industry leader in hardware wallets
  - **Funding**: $380M+ raised (Series C at $1.4B valuation)
  - **Differentiator**: Physical device security, offline storage
  - **Weakness vs Zengo**: Complex setup, hardware costs ($79-$149+), slower transactions, less user-friendly
- **Trust Wallet (Binance)**
  - **Focus**: Mobile-first multi-chain wallet
  - **Users**: 60+ million users
  - **Funding**: Acquired by Binance (2018)
  - **Differentiator**: Binance ecosystem integration, widest asset support
  - **Weakness vs Zengo**: Seed phrase vulnerability, centralized company concerns
- **Phantom**
  - **Focus**: Solana ecosystem primary wallet
  - **Funding**: $109M raised (Series B at $1.2B valuation)
  - **Differentiator**: Best-in-class Solana experience, NFT focus
  - **Weakness vs Zengo**: Chain-specific (though expanding), seed phrase model
### **Competitive Advantages**
1. **MPC Security Leadership**: Only consumer wallet with battle-tested MPC (zero hacks since 2018)
1. **Premium Business Model**: Sustainable SA-AS model vs fragile transaction-only models
1. **Patent Protection**: 4 US + 1 EU registered MPC patents
1. **Full-Stack Execution**: Unlike MPC "stack" providers, Zengo owns the complete user experience
1. **Unique Feature Set**: Legacy transfer, theft protection, secured vaults cannot be replicated by seed phrase wallets
### **Competitive Landscape Summary**
The crypto wallet market is highly fragmented with different players dominating specific niches (MetaMask for DeFi, Ledger for cold storage, Phantom for Solana). Most competitors rely on vulnerable seed phrase architecture. Zengo's differentiation lies in bringing institutional-grade MPC security to retail users while building a sustainable premium business model. The company positions itself as the "primary super app" where users consolidate assets across all chains, rather than a chain-specific or use-case-specific wallet.
## **Market Position**
---
### **Positioning Statement**
Zengo positions itself as "the premium super app for digital assets" - a category-defining product that combines institutional-grade MPC security with consumer-friendly UX and a sustainable premium business model that serves beginners, advanced users, and business teams.
### **Competitive Moats**
1. **Technology Moat**: Proprietary MPC implementation with 4+ years of battle-testing and patent protection
1. **Brand/Trust Moat**: Zero hacks track record, #1 G2 rating, #3 Hacken security ranking creates strong trust
1. **Network Effects**: Growing Teams product creates user-to-user adoption flywheel

### **Market Opportunity**
- **TAM**: $2.5 trillion digital asset market
- **SAM**: Premium digital security market - Password managers ($10B+), Anti-virus ($10B+), VPNs ($30B), Identity theft protection, Neobank premiums
- **Target**: 5% of TAM = $100M ARR (medium-term vision)
- **Growth Drivers**:
  - Bitcoin ETF approvals driving mainstream adoption
  - 100-200M active crypto users worldwide
  - DeFi growth surpassing centralized exchanges
  - Increasing complexity of on-chain economy requiring better security
### **Risks and Challenges**
1. **Market Risk**: Crypto market volatility directly impacts AUM and transaction volumes
1. **Competitive Risk**: Well-funded competitors (Ledger, Phantom) could develop MPC solutions
1. **Regulatory Risk**: Evolving crypto regulations could impact wallet operations or require licensing
1. **Technology Risk**: Theoretical vulnerabilities in MPC could emerge (though extensively audited)
1. **Adoption Risk**: Premium model depends on users' willingness to pay for security
### **SWOT Summary**
| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| Unmatched MPC security (zero hacks) | Limited blockchain support vs competitors (no Solana, XRP) |
| Premium business model with strong unit economics | Smaller user base than MetaMask/Trust Wallet |
| Patent-protected technology | Dependency on crypto market cycles |
| Strong brand trust and ratings | Premium pricing limits mass market penetration |
| Opportunities | Threats |
| Massive crypto adoption wave (ETF era) | Competitors developing MPC solutions |
