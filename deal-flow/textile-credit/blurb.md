TEXTILE CREDIT | Programmable Private Credit Protocol | Raising [UNKNOWN] @ [UNKNOWN] | Deck

DeFi infrastructure for tokenized private credit markets - originators create permissionless debt pools, LPs earn 10-16% yields, curators manage diversified baskets. Novel secondary market mechanism solves private credit liquidity problem.

Traction:
• Product status: UNCLEAR (claims "architecture live" but no mainnet confirmation)
• TVL/Users: NOT DISCLOSED
• Partnerships: NONE PUBLIC

Team: Tomer Bariach (GoodDollar founder, Flori Ventures GP, Bancor token economics) - STRONG. Co-founder Benoit Nolens - UNVERIFIED (RED FLAG)

Deal: [NO TERMS DISCLOSED]
Token: $TEXT planned, TGE timing unknown

## Detailed Assessment

### Why Interesting

**STRONG POSITIVES:**
1. **Sector Alignment** - RWA Private Credit is Notalone's actively liked category; identified as 2025's primary growth driver
2. **Technical Innovation** - Novel programmable credit architecture, secondary market pricing mechanism (duration-based discounts), data validation layer
3. **Founder Quality** - Tomer Bariach: GoodDollar protocol architect, Flori Ventures GP, Bancor token economics expert, 8+ years DeFi/emerging markets
4. **Market Opportunity** - $1.6T TradFi private credit TAM, $50-100B tokenized opportunity, capital shifting from Treasuries (4-5%) to private credit (10-16%)
5. **Clear Business Model** - Fee auctions for pool access, curator performance fees, deflationary token burns

### Critical Red Flags

**BLOCKERS:**
1. **Team Verification Failure** - Second co-founder (Benoit Nolens) completely unverifiable; no LinkedIn, no web presence, no connection to project found
2. **Zero Traction Disclosure** - No TVL, users, pools, partnerships, or metrics despite claiming "architecture is live"
3. **Missing Investment Terms** - No entry valuation, TGE timeline, token unlocks, allocation details
4. **No Funding Transparency** - No disclosed investors, amounts raised, or runway data
5. **No Hedging Plan** - No CEX listing plans or perpetual futures strategy (MANDATORY per Notalone criteria)

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- Late to market (Goldfinch, Centrifuge, Credix have 1-3 year head start with proven traction)
- Regulatory risk (tokenized debt = securities in most jurisdictions, no disclosed compliance strategy)
- Credit risk (platform success depends on loan repayment; permissionless pools could attract bad actors)
- No smart contract audits disclosed

### Notalone Filters Assessment

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Sector** | ✅ PASS | RWA Private Credit - Actively Liked |
| **Token** | ✅ PASS | $TEXT planned |
| **Team** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Tomer verified (STRONG), co-founder unverified (RED FLAG) |
| **TGE Timing** | ❌ UNKNOWN | No timeline disclosed; H1 2026 preferred |
| **Valuation (FDV)** | ❌ UNKNOWN | Cannot assess ≤$50M filter |
| **Token Unlocks** | ❌ UNKNOWN | No vesting schedule disclosed |
| **Product Stage** | ⚠️ UNCLEAR | Claims "live" but no mainnet confirmation |
| **Traction** | ❌ FAIL | Zero public metrics |
| **Social Proof** | ❌ FAIL | No disclosed investors |
| **Hedging** | ❌ UNKNOWN | No CEX/perps plan (BLOCKER) |

**Scorecard:** 2/10 clear pass, 2/10 partial, 6/10 fail/unknown

### Critical Questions for Intro Call

**MUST ANSWER (Blockers):**
1. Who is Benoit Nolens? What is his background, role, and why no digital presence?
2. What is the full team composition? (size, key roles, backgrounds)
3. What is the product status? (Mainnet/testnet, launch date, where to verify on-chain)
4. What are current metrics? (TVL, pools, users, volume, growth)
5. What funding raised? (amount, investors, valuation, runway)
6. What are investment terms? (entry FDV, TGE timeline, token unlocks, allocation)
7. What are CEX listing plans? (exchanges, perpetual futures for hedging)
8. What are smart contract audit results?

**SHOULD ANSWER:**
- Partnerships/LOIs with originators?
- Legal structure and regulatory strategy?
- Go-to-market plan for originator onboarding?
- Unit economics assumptions?
- Tomer's time allocation (Textile vs. Flori Ventures)?

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- **Goldfinch** - a16z-backed, $100M+ TVL at peak, 2+ years operational
- **Centrifuge** - Well-funded, mature Tinlake protocol for asset tokenization
- **Credix** - $11.25M raised (2022), focus on LatAm institutional credit
- **Maple Finance** - Institutional crypto-native lending (faced defaults)
- **Untangled Finance** - $13.5M raised (2023), supply chain finance focus

**Textile Differentiation:**
- Programmable credit vaults (rule-based allocation)
- Novel secondary market (duration-based pricing)
- Permissionless pool creation (vs. gated approaches)
- Emerging market focus (vs. institutional/developed markets)
- Data validation layer for trust

**Market Context:**
- RWA private credit: $546.8M in active loans (April 2025)
- Growing rapidly: identified as 2025's primary RWA growth driver
- Yield migration: Treasuries (4-5%) → Private Credit (10-16%)
- Multiple winners possible in early market

### Token Economics (Preliminary)

**Token:** $TEXT
**Utility:** Access rights to high-demand loan pools via fee auctions
**Mechanism:** LPs bid TEXT tokens for staking priority in limited-capacity pools
**Distribution:** Per-block emissions to pool managers, curators, data validators (claimable only at loan lifetime for accountability)
**Deflationary:** Fixed % of auction fees burned

**UNKNOWN:**
- Total supply
- Distribution % (team, investors, community, ecosystem)
- Unlock schedules
- TGE unlock %
- Launch FDV

### Investment Sizing Guidance

**CANNOT PROVIDE** - No entry valuation, TGE timeline, or unlock data available

### Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL INTEREST - Schedule Intro Call**

**Rationale:**
- Strong sector fit (RWA private credit is hot + Notalone actively likes)
- Exceptional founder (Tomer Bariach has relevant track record)
- Novel technical approach with genuine innovation
- BUT: Too many critical data gaps to make investment decision
- BLOCKER: Co-founder unverified violates "known team" requirement
- BLOCKER: No hedging plan (mandatory per Notalone criteria)

**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule call with Tomer Bariach
2. Address Critical Questions (especially team composition, traction, terms)
3. Request data room access if answers satisfactory
4. GO/NO-GO decision post-call

**Decision Point:**
- If critical gaps filled satisfactorily → Proceed to full DD
- If red flags persist (especially team verification) → PASS or SHOWCASE
- If wrong timing/stage for Notalone filters → SHOWCASE

**Timeline:** Intro call within 1-2 weeks, GO/NO-GO decision post-call
