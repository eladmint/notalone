### Technology Architecture

### Business Model
- **On-Chain APY (5-10%)**: Trading fees in DEX pools via CLMM/DLMM rebalancing protocols (Kamino, UltraLP)
- **Off-Chain APY (+5%)**:
  - Call options (selling covered calls against collateral)
  - Dividends (yield from backing stocks, bonds, ETFs)

### GTM Strategy (3 Phases)

**Phase II:** $SHFT Utility Token TGE
**Phase III:** Lending Pools Protocol

**The Building Blocks:**
1. **Blockchain Foundation** - Promoting Web3 ecosystem adoption via social media, PR exposure, workshops, events, incentives for LPs and MMs
2. **dApps (Spot DEX and Lending)** - Promoting Shift Stocks by listing them on trading platforms (incl. Testnet trading challenge for Airdrop campaign)
3. **Liquidity Providers** - Providing liquidity for Shift Stocks CLMM/DLMM pools, ensuring market makers can trade tokens seamlessly
4. **Market Makers / Algo traders** - Guaranteeing early trading volume to ensure LP pool revenue offsets impermanent loss risk, and Shift Stocks are trending on charts

### Competitive Advantage
Unlike competitors (xStocks, Stablestock, Robinhood, Helix/GMX Synthetics):

| Feature | SHIFT Stocks | Competitors |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Type** | ARTs (Asset-Reference Tokens) | Wrapped Security Tokens / Synthetic |
| **24/7 Permissionless Trading** | ✅ YES | ❌ Partial/NO |
| **24/5 Mint & Redeem** | ✅ YES | ❌ Limited/NO |
| **Whitelisted on DEXs/dApps/CEX** | ✅ YES | ❌ NO (requires licenses) |
| **Backing Asset Type** | Stocks | Stocks / CFD / Synthetic |
| **Regulatory Classification** | Cryptocurrencies | Securities / Unclear |
| **License** | MiCAR (Austria FMA) | No License / 3rd party |

**Key Differentiator:** SHIFT Stocks classified as **Cryptocurrencies - not Securities** under MiCAR. This enables true permissionless access without additional integrations or verifications required by market makers and DeFi users.

### Tokenomics ($SHFT Utility Token)
**Total Supply:** 1 Billion tokens

**Allocation:**
- 28% Token Sale (Pre-Seed 4%, Seed 10%, Strategic 2%, Private 10%, Public 2%)
- 18% Team and Advisors
- 24% DAO Reserves
- 15% Liquidity supply
- 15% Ecosystem Growth

**Token Utility:**
- **$SHFT Buyback**: Every time a new Shift Stock (ARTs) is minted, a $SHFT buyback mechanism is activated
- **$SHFT Lock**: Following buyback, smart-contract locks $SHFT tokens outside the circulating supply (unless when Shift Stocks burning > minting)
- **Earn $SHFT**: Contribute to Shift Stocks liquidity using Shift Vaults dApp, and earn $SHFT tokens
- **Stake $SHFT**: Users may stake $SHFT tokens for voting, proposals, and share of protocols revenue from Shift Vaults and other Shift Stocks activities

**Why $SHFT is the next x1000:**
The price of $SHFT is directly tied to the Shift Stocks TVL and the DEX Trading Fees. **Shift Stocks success = $SHFT token x1000**
