## Executive Summary

Addressable is a Web3 marketing intelligence platform that enables data-driven user acquisition and campaign optimization for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. The company has raised $13.5M in funding and serves over 100 Web3 companies including major players like Circle, Polygon, Uniswap, and Chainlink. Their core innovation lies in matching crypto wallet addresses to social media accounts, enabling targeted marketing campaigns that bridge Web2 advertising channels with Web3 audiences.

## 1. Company Overview

### What Addressable Does

Addressable provides a comprehensive Web3 marketing intelligence platform that allows blockchain companies to:

- **Target wallet owners** based on on-chain and off-chain activity across 7 blockchains
- **Track attribution** from Web2 advertising to Web3 conversions (wallet connections, transactions)
- **Analyze user behavior** with 450+ daily metrics
- **Optimize campaigns** using AI-driven recommendations to reduce customer acquisition costs

### The Problem They Solve

Traditional marketing tools like Google Analytics and Facebook Ads fail in the Web3 context because:

1. **Anonymity barrier**: Blockchain wallets are pseudonymous, making it impossible to identify and target users through conventional means
2. **Attribution gap**: No way to connect ad impressions to on-chain actions (token purchases, NFT mints, DeFi transactions)
3. **Audience fragmentation**: Web3 users are dispersed across multiple chains and communities
4. **Wasted ad spend**: Without wallet-based targeting, crypto projects advertise blindly to unqualified audiences

Addressable bridges this gap by matching anonymous wallet addresses to social media accounts, enabling precision targeting previously impossible in the Web3 space.
