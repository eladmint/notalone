LAVA Network | Modular Access Layer for Blockchain Data | Token Listed (July 2024) | FDV $135M | Deck

Lava is a decentralized RPC infrastructure marketplace connecting 50+ blockchains through a peer-to-peer network of node providers. The protocol solves blockchain data access fragmentation - enabling dApps, wallets, exchanges, and AI agents to access any chain without centralized providers like Infura or Alchemy.

Traction:
• 140B+ relays served (all-time), 2B+ daily RPC requests
• $3.5M+ protocol revenue since mainnet launch (Aug 2024)
• 1M+ weekly users across 50+ supported chains
• 5x YoY growth, 3.5x public RPC traffic growth (2025)
• 75% token staking ratio, 42M tokens burned (deflationary)

Strategic Partners: Kraken (Smart Router integration), Google Cloud (Autonomous Economy), Fireblocks, MIT (AI collaboration)

Ecosystem Integrations: NEAR, Starknet, Filecoin, Axelar, Hedera, Midnight (official RPC partner status)

Team: Yair Cleper (CEO, founder Supersmart - $10M raise), Gil Binder (CTO, serial entrepreneur, cybersecurity expert)

Funding: $26M raised from Jump Capital, HashKey Capital, Tribe Capital, Animoca Brands, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal

Token Economics:
• FDV: $135M (current market valuation)
• Deflationary: 80% fee burn when >80% staked (75% currently staked)
• Dual-mining: Providers earn LAVA + chain tokens (NEAR, AXL, etc.)
• Vesting: 4-year schedule, Year 2 unlock (July 2026) = 33% investor/team tokens

Investment Thesis:
• Strong PMF: Revenue-generating infrastructure with real usage (140B+ relays)
• Institutional validation: Kraken, Google Cloud, Fireblocks partnerships
• Technical moat: "Lazy blockchain" architecture + modular Spec system (permissionless chain addition)
• DePIN tailwind: Decentralized infrastructure narrative, multi-chain proliferation (50→100+ chains)
• AI agent economy: Positioned for "Agentic Web" (autonomous agents + blockchain data)

Key Risks:
• Already listed (TGE July 2024) - OTC opportunity only
• FDV $135M exceeds Notalone $50M threshold (requires ≥50% OTC discount)
• Year 2 unlock cliff (July 2026) creates sell pressure risk
• Competitive market: Pocket Network (decentralized incumbent), Infura/Alchemy (centralized giants)
• Incentive pool dependency (chain foundations fund bootstrapping)

CEX Listings: Bybit, KuCoin, Kraken (MiCA compliant), Gate.io (perpetual futures available for hedging)

Recommendation: SHOWCASE - Add to pipeline for investor visibility. Consider OTC only if ≥50% discount available.
