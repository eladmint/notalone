## 7b. Token Economics
[Confidence: MEDIUM]

### Token Overview

| Parameter | Value | Notalone Filter |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Token Status** | Planned | Token required ✅ |
| **TGE Date** | [NOT DISCLOSED] | H1 2026 preferred ❓ |
| **Expected Launch FDV** | [NOT DISCLOSED] | ≤$50M preferred ❓ |

| **Entry→TGE Multiple** | [CANNOT CALCULATE] | Need TGE FDV estimate |

**Source:** Deck page 25, 27

### Token Utility Model

**Value Accrual Mechanisms** (Deck page 25):

1. **Buy & Burn**:
   - % of protocol revenue used to buy & burn tokens
   - Creates deflationary pressure based on usage
   - Ties token value directly to trading volume

2. **Stake to Participate & Unlock**:
   - Required staking for advanced features
   - Specifically: Auto Trader advanced compute, models, and strategies
   - Creates token demand from power users

3. **Performance Incentives**:
   - Rewards for strategy sharing
   - Agent performance bounties
   - Community contributions
   - Encourages ecosystem participation

## 11. Investment Fit Assessment
[Confidence: HIGH]

### Notalone Screening Scorecard

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **TGE Timing** | ❓ | [NOT DISCLOSED] - Must verify H1 2026 timeline in DD |
| **Product Stage** | ✅ | Live product, functional, 5 weeks post-Auto Trader launch |
| **Business Model** | ✅ | Clear revenue model (trading fees + staking), early but scalable |
| **Founders' Experience** | ✅ | Crypto since 2017, serial entrepreneur (Apester), VP R&D background |
| **Token Unlocks** | ❓ | [NOT DISCLOSED] - Need unlock schedule ≤18 months |
| **Sector** | ✅ | AI + Trading Infrastructure (both actively liked sectors) |
| **Valuation (FDV)** | ✅ | $15M cap ≤ $40M seed threshold, below ideal range ($25-40M) |
| **Momentum/Traction** | ✅ | Strong: 81% retention, 29% conversion, +998% volume growth |
| **Social Proof** | ✅ | Wix Ventures, PrimeVC, Ariel Maislos (ex-Kraken CEO) |

**Scorecard Result:** 6/9 criteria confirmed ✅, 3/9 need verification ❓

**Assessment**: Strong preliminary fit, pending tokenomics disclosure

### PMF (Product-Market Fit) Indicators

- [x] **Live product with users** - 2,480 WAU, live trading happening
- [x] **Organic growth (not airdrop-driven)** - 100% organic, no token yet
- [x] **Retention metrics available** - 81% monthly, ~50% daily retention
- [x] **Revenue or clear path to revenue** - $10K fees generated, clear fee model
- [x] **Users would be disappointed if product disappeared** - High retention + top-up rate suggests strong engagement

**PMF Assessment**: ✅ **STRONG SIGNALS** - All 5 indicators positive

**Evidence**:
- 81% monthly retention (industry benchmark: 20-40% for crypto apps)
- 50% of users topped up (strong re-engagement)
- 29% conversion to paid feature (Auto Trader)
- +998% volume growth in 2 months
- User testimonials in deck showing enthusiasm

**Source:** Deck pages 13, 16, 18

### Runway Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current runway | [NOT DISCLOSED - pre-funding] |
| Can reach TGE without new funding? | ❓ Unknown - depends on TGE timeline |
| Burn rate | ~$100-150K/month [ESTIMATED] |
| Raise amount | $2.5-4M |
| Post-funding runway | 17-40 months [CALCULATED: $2.5M-$4M / $100-150K] |

**Runway Analysis**:
- If TGE in H1 2026 (~18 months), $2.5M raise provides adequate runway
- If TGE delayed to H2 2026 (~24 months), may need additional capital
- [CRITICAL]: Must confirm TGE timeline and expected milestones
