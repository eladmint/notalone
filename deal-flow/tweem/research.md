## 1. Company Overview
[Confidence: MEDIUM]

### What They Do

Tweem provides a prediction market platform built on social attention, allowing users to:

- **Predict tweet virality**: Browse curated tweets and bet on whether they'll become "bangers" (viral hits) or flop
- **Rapid feedback loops**: Unlike traditional prediction markets (elections, sports) that take weeks/months to resolve, tweet virality resolves within hours
- **Social skill monetization**: Convert understanding of internet culture and trend-spotting ability into financial returns

**Source:** [Tweem.lol website](https://www.tweem.lol/), [Crypto Mate article](https://cryptom8.com/11/01/tweem-lol/)

### The Problem They Solve

**Problem 1: Slow Resolution in Traditional Prediction Markets**
Traditional prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) focus on events that take weeks, months, or years to resolve (elections, sports championships, macro events). This creates long capital lockup periods and delayed gratification.

**Problem 2: Untapped Social Media Prediction Category**
Despite Twitter/X being a primary cultural battleground where trends emerge and die within hours, there was no liquid prediction market specifically for social media virality.

**Problem 3: Barrier Between Social Activity and Financial Markets**
Users spend hours on social media developing intuition about what content resonates, but had no way to monetize this skill beyond traditional content creation.

**Tweem's Solution:**
Tweem creates a fast-paced prediction market specifically for tweet virality, enabling users to:
- Place bets on viral potential within minutes
- Get resolution and feedback within hours (not weeks)
- Monetize their social media intuition directly
- Participate in multiple prediction cycles per day

## 7b. Token Economics (If Applicable)
[Confidence: LOW]

### Token Overview

**TOKEN CONFIRMED:** Per deck, "Utility is core to tweem's long term sustainability and the foundation for creating a future coin that becomes one of the largest alt coins ever made."

**Use of Funds:** "Begin development toward a future TGE" is explicitly listed in the $1M seed use of funds.

**Source:** [Deck - Token Plans & Use of Funds slides] [SELF-REPORTED]

| Parameter | Value | Notalone Filter | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Token Status** | ✅ CONFIRMED (token project) | Token required | ✅ PASS |
| **TGE Date** | Development starting, no date specified | H1 2026 preferred | ⚠️ UNKNOWN |
| **Expected Launch FDV** | Not disclosed | ≤$50M preferred | ❓ Unknown |
| **Entry FDV** | $10M | Pre-seed: $10-15M, Seed: $25-40M | ✅ EXCELLENT ($10M) |
| **Entry→TGE Multiple** | Cannot calculate (no TGE FDV) | Minimum 1.5x, ideally 2-4x | ❓ Unknown |

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Token project confirmed (not equity-only)
- ✅ Entry valuation excellent ($10M vs $25-40M preferred)
- ❌ No TGE timeline (CRITICAL GAP for Notalone H1 2026 preference)

### Token Vision & Strategy

**Per Deck:**
- "Utility is core to tweem's long term sustainability"
- "Foundation for creating a future coin that becomes one of the largest alt coins ever made"
- TGE development is part of current fundraise use of funds

**Implied Token Utility:**
1. **Points-to-Token Conversion**: Existing XP/points system likely converts to tokens
2. **Platform Utility**: Required for advanced features, data pipelines, alpha channels (per roadmap)
3. **Community Incentives**: Rewards for predictions, streaks, cult participation

**Points Program (Current):**
- Users earn XP and "tweem points" for correct predictions
- 6+ month daily streaks indicate strong engagement
- Leaderboards track top predictors across seasons
- "Cults" feature for team-based point hunting

### Indirect Competitors

**Social Betting Platforms:**
- Traditional sports betting apps (DraftKings, FanDuel) expanding into prediction markets
- Social trading platforms (eToro, etc.)
- Meme coin speculation (similar fast-paced, cultural betting)

### Competitive Advantages

1. **Niche Focus**: Only platform exclusively focused on Twitter virality prediction
   - Defensibility: Deep specialization vs. broad generalization

2. **Speed**: Hour-scale resolution vs. day/week/month-scale for competitors
   - Enables multiple daily betting cycles
   - Appeals to high-frequency traders

3. **Solana Infrastructure**: Fast + cheap vs. Polygon/Ethereum competitors
   - Enables micro-bets economically

4. **Cultural Positioning**: Targets crypto-native Twitter power users specifically
   - Community fit with target demographic

5. **Low Liquidity Requirements**: Smaller market sizes acceptable for niche category
   - Can succeed with lower TVL than broad platforms

**Source:** [Self-assessed based on product analysis]

### Competitive Disadvantages

1. **Scale Disadvantage**: Polymarket ($18.4B volume), BET (exceeded Polymarket in daily volume)
   - Network effects favor liquidity leaders
   - Harder to attract market makers

2. **Late Mover in Hot Space**: Prediction markets saw explosion in 2024
   - Polymarket, Kalshi, BET, Robinhood, DraftKings all well-capitalized
   - Crowded market awareness

3. **Platform Risk**: Heavy dependency on Twitter/X API
   - Already experienced API bugs (January 2025)
   - Subject to Twitter's platform policies and changes

4. **Limited Moat**: Concept could be replicated by larger players
   - Polymarket or BET could add Twitter virality category easily
   - No obvious technical or regulatory moat

5. **Niche TAM**: Twitter virality may be smaller TAM than broad events
   - Limits scale potential vs. competitors

6. **No Institutional Appeal**: Unlike Kalshi or Robinhood, lacks regulatory structure
   - Limited to crypto-native users

**Source:** [Competitive analysis based on public information]

### Competitive Landscape Summary

**Market Position:** Tweem is a fast-following niche player in a rapidly growing but increasingly crowded prediction market space.

**Strategic Question:** Can deep vertical focus on Twitter virality create a defensible niche, or will broader platforms subsume this category?

**Analogies:**
- **Bull Case:** Like how TikTok focused on short video vs. YouTube's broad video → niche focus won
- **Bear Case:** Like how specialized crypto exchanges lost to Binance/Coinbase's broad coverage

**Market Dynamics:**
- Prediction market sector: Rapidly expanding (2024-2025)
- Twitter integration: Novel but replicable
- Solana ecosystem: Growing but less mature than Ethereum/Polygon
- User acquisition: Highly competitive for crypto-native users

## 10. Market Position
[Confidence: MEDIUM]

### Positioning Statement

**Current Positioning:** "The first prediction market built on social attention" where users "bet on virality."

**Source:** [Tweem.lol](https://www.tweem.lol/), pitch deck meta description

**Positioning Analysis:**
- **"First"**: Questionable - Polymarket and others have had social/cultural betting. First *exclusively* Twitter-focused? Possibly.
- **"Social Attention"**: Clear differentiation from politics/sports/macro events
- **"Bet on Virality"**: Accessible, culturally resonant framing for crypto-native Twitter users

### Competitive Moats

1. **First-Mover in Micro-Niche**: First to focus exclusively on Twitter virality predictions
   - **Strength:** WEAK - Easily replicable
   - **Durability:** LOW - No technical or regulatory barrier to copycats

2. **Community & Brand**: Building crypto-Twitter native community around virality culture
   - **Strength:** MEDIUM - 12.1K X + 121K Telegram is early traction
   - **Durability:** MEDIUM - Community takes time but can be outspent by larger players

3. **Product Specialization**: Deep focus on tweet virality mechanics vs. broad platform
   - **Strength:** MEDIUM - Can optimize UX/algorithm for single use case
   - **Durability:** MEDIUM - But vulnerable to feature parity from larger platforms

4. **Speed Advantage**: Hour-scale resolution vs. day/week/month for traditional markets
   - **Strength:** MEDIUM - Appeals to high-frequency traders
   - **Durability:** LOW - Not unique to Tweem, inherent to the category

**Overall Moat Assessment:** WEAK
- No strong defensibility identified
- Vulnerable to competitive dynamics
- Relies on execution speed and community loyalty

### Market Opportunity

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- Global prediction markets: Rapidly growing (Polymarket $18.4B+ volume in 2024)
- Crypto-native users: ~500M globally
- Active Twitter users: 611M monthly actives
- Intersection: Millions of potential users

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**
- Crypto-native Twitter power users interested in prediction markets
- Estimated: Low millions
- [CALCULATED - No official estimates]

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
- Current: 12.1K X followers, 121K Telegram subscribers
- Active users: [NOT FOUND]
- Market share: Negligible vs. Polymarket/BET but growing

**Growth Drivers:**
1. **Prediction market sector boom** (2024-2025): Rising tide lifts all boats
2. **Crypto-Twitter cultural fit**: Product aligns with target audience behavior
3. **Solana ecosystem growth**: Benefits from broader Solana adoption
4. **Virality mechanics**: Potential for viral growth loops (users betting on tweets they then promote)

**Growth Headwinds:**
1. **Intense competition**: Well-funded incumbents and new entrants
2. **Platform risk**: Twitter/X API dependency
3. **Regulatory uncertainty**: Prediction markets under scrutiny (Polymarket, Kalshi issues)
4. **Crypto market cycles**: User activity correlated with crypto bull/bear markets

### Risks and Challenges

#### High-Severity Risks

1. **Twitter Platform Risk** [HIGH]
   - **Description:** Heavy dependency on Twitter/X API for core functionality
   - **Evidence:** Already experienced API bugs requiring workarounds (January 2025)
   - **Mitigation:** [NOT FOUND]

   - **Evidence:** Polymarket faced CFTC enforcement (2022), ongoing political prediction market debates
   - **Impact:** Could limit geographic availability, require licenses, or force shutdown
   - **Mitigation:** [NOT FOUND - No compliance strategy disclosed]

4. **Liquidity Risk** [MEDIUM-HIGH]
   - **Description:** Prediction markets require critical mass of liquidity to function
   - **Current State:** [NOT FOUND - No TVL or volume data]
   - **Impact:** Thin markets → poor odds → user churn
   - **Mitigation:** [NOT FOUND]

#### Medium-Severity Risks

5. **Market Manipulation Risk** [MEDIUM]
   - **Description:** Users could bet on tweets then artificially pump engagement (like bots, coordinated campaigns)
   - **Mitigation:** [NOT FOUND - No disclosed anti-manipulation measures]
   - **Impact:** Erodes trust, platform credibility

6. **Solana Network Risk** [MEDIUM]
   - **Description:** Solana has history of network outages and instability
   - **Recent:** Network stable in 2024 but past issues create FUD
   - **Impact:** Could disrupt betting, settlements, user experience
   - **Mitigation:** Inherent to Solana choice, cannot fully mitigate

7. **Token Economics Risk** [MEDIUM]
   - **Description:** [CANNOT ASSESS - No tokenomics disclosed]
   - **Concern:** Poor tokenomics could lead to sell pressure, misaligned incentives
   - **Requires:** Deck access for evaluation

8. **Team Depth Risk** [MEDIUM]
   - **Description:** Only one founder publicly identified, no verifiable team
   - **Impact:** Execution risk, key person dependency
   - **Evidence:** Limited public team information

#### Lower-Severity Risks

9. **Twitter Cultural Shifts** [MEDIUM-LOW]
   - **Description:** Changes in Twitter usage, algorithms, or culture could reduce virality predictability
   - **Impact:** Could make prediction market less engaging or profitable for users

10. **User Acquisition Cost** [MEDIUM-LOW]
    - **Description:** Crowded crypto market, high competition for attention
    - **Impact:** Expensive to acquire users, challenging unit economics
    - **Current State:** [NOT FOUND - No CAC data]

## 11. Investment Fit Assessment
[Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH]

### Notalone Screening Scorecard

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **TGE Timing** | ⚠️ UNCLEAR | TGE development starting (per use of funds), but no specific timeline. CRITICAL: Must align with H1 2026 for Notalone. Requires clarification. |
| **Product Stage** | ✅ PASS | Live product, functional, 200K bets placed. 3 months post-launch with strong engagement (6+ month streaks). |
| **Business Model** | ✅ PASS | Signal engine model clear. Token utility core. B2B partnerships (Polymarket/Kalshi) in discussion. Revenue path visible. |
| **Founders' Experience** | ✅ PASS | Eden: Microsoft engineer, Perpie founder, tres.finance founding team. Technical + startup experience verified. |
| **Token Unlocks** | ❓ Unknown | Token confirmed. Unlock schedule not disclosed. Requires clarification. |
| **Sector** | ✅ PASS | Prediction markets / Consumer apps with traction / Native Web3. Fits "Actively Like" categories. NOT Gaming/Metaverse/NFT. |
| **Valuation (FDV)** | ✅ EXCELLENT | $10M entry FDV - well below Notalone $50M max, ideal for seed stage ($25-40M typical). Strong entry point. |
| **Momentum/Traction** | ✅ STRONG | 200K bets placed, 12K X / 121K TG, 6+ month daily streaks, 10K DAU target in 3-6 months. Strong early traction. |
| **Social Proof** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | $300K from 2 "leading VCs" (names not disclosed). Polymarket/Kalshi discussions. Limited public validation. |

**Scorecard Result:** 6 Clear Pass / 2 Partial / 1 Unknown = STRONG screening result (deck addressed most gaps)

**Assessment:** Strong fit on most criteria. Main gaps: TGE timeline and tokenomics details needed for final decision.

### PMF (Product-Market Fit) Indicators

- [✓] Live product with users - YES (200K bets placed, 12K X, 121K TG)
- [✓] Strong retention signals - YES (6+ month daily streaks from power users)
- [✓] Organic growth evident - YES (100% free to play, users engaging without token incentives yet)
- [✓] Revenue or clear path to revenue - YES (token utility model, B2B data partnerships planned)
- [~] Users would be disappointed if product disappeared - LIKELY YES (6+ month daily streaks indicate high engagement/commitment)

**PMF Assessment:** Early positive PMF signals. 6+ month daily streaks are exceptionally strong retention indicator for 3-month-old product.

### Runway Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total raised | $300K (confirmed from deck) |
| Currently raising | $1M seed at $10M valuation |
| Use of funds | Team expansion (2 devs, designer, community lead) + TGE development |
| Estimated runway with $1M | 12-18 months (estimated ~$60-80K/month burn with 4-5 team) |
| Can reach TGE without new funding? | YES (TGE development explicitly in use of funds) |

**Runway Risk:** LOW - $1M seed should provide sufficient runway to TGE assuming reasonable development timeline

---

## 12. Investment Considerations (Internal)
[Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH]

### Deal Recommendation

| Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|
| ⬜ **INVEST** | |
| ✅ **INVEST (CONDITIONAL)** | **Strong fundamentals, excellent valuation, proven traction. CONDITIONAL on TGE timeline alignment (H1 2026) and acceptable tokenomics (unlocks, CEX plans).** |
| ⬜ **SERVICES** | |
| ⬜ **SHOWCASE** | |

**Investment Size Suggested:** Participate in $1M seed round (allocation TBD)

**Conditions for Final INVEST:**
1. ✅ TGE timeline: Must confirm H1 2026 or earlier (Notalone preference)
2. ✅ Token unlocks: TGE unlock ≥10% (20% ideal), fully unlocked ≤18 months post-TGE
3. ✅ CEX listing path: Clear plan for CEX with perpetual futures (hedging requirement)
4. ⚠️ Reference check: Verify VC names, check references on Eden's previous ventures (Perpie, tres.finance)
5. ⚠️ Polymarket/Kalshi partnerships: Validate partnership discussions, assess strategic value

### Why Interesting

1. **Excellent Valuation Entry**: $10M valuation is significantly below Notalone's $25-40M seed preference and $50M maximum. Creates strong entry→TGE multiple potential.

2. **Proven Traction (Not Speculation)**:
   - 200K bets placed in 3 months
   - 6+ month daily streaks (exceptional retention)
   - 12.1K X / 121K TG community
   - 100% free to play (not airdrop-driven)

3. **Strong Sector Fit**: Prediction markets booming (Polymarket $18.4B volume). Aligns with Notalone "Actively Like" (Consumer apps with traction, Native Web3).

4. **Experienced Founder**: Eden has Microsoft engineering background + startup experience (Perpie founder, tres.finance founding team). Product execution demonstrates technical capability.

5. **Differentiated Positioning**: Only platform focused exclusively on Twitter virality. Signal engine value proposition for B2B (Polymarket/Kalshi partnerships).

6. **Clear Use of Funds**: Specific hiring plan (2 devs, designer, community lead) + TGE development. Capital efficient ($300K raised, $1M raise).

7. **B2B Revenue Opportunity**: Active discussions with Polymarket/Kalshi for attention-driven dataset. Data pipeline product in roadmap.

8. **Token Confirmed**: Token project (not equity-only). "Utility is core," TGE development starting. Points program active (future airdrop likely).

9. **Strategic Roadmap**: Clear 3-track expansion (global, high-engagement communities, utility features). 10K DAU target in 3-6 months.

10. **Viral Growth Loops**: Users bet on tweets → promote tweets to win → brings platform awareness. Built-in marketing mechanism.

### Concerns

#### CRITICAL (Must Resolve Before Investment)

1. **🔴 No TGE Timeline Specified [HIGH SEVERITY]** ← BLOCKER
   - Deck confirms token project and TGE development starting
   - No specific launch date or timeline disclosed
   - **Impact:** Cannot assess alignment with Notalone H1 2026 preference
   - **Action Required:** Request TGE timeline in founder call
   - **Blocker:** Notalone requires TGE timing visibility for fund strategy

2. **🔴 No Tokenomics Details [HIGH SEVERITY]** ← BLOCKER
   - Token supply, distribution, vesting not disclosed
   - No unlock schedule (TGE %, cliff, full unlock timeline)
   - No target launch FDV disclosed
   - **Impact:** Cannot assess Notalone requirements (≥10% TGE unlock, ≤18 month full unlock)
   - **Action Required:** Request full tokenomics deck in follow-up
   - **Blocker:** Core investment criteria cannot be verified

3. **🔴 No CEX Listing Strategy [HIGH SEVERITY]** ← BLOCKER
   - No disclosed plan for centralized exchange listings
   - No mention of perpetual futures availability
   - **Impact:** Notalone requires hedging capability (CEX with liquid perpetual futures)
   - **Action Required:** Clarify CEX strategy and market maker relationships
   - **Blocker:** Hedging is non-negotiable for Notalone

#### SIGNIFICANT (Major Concerns - Should Resolve)

4. **🟠 Unknown Prior VC Names [MEDIUM SEVERITY]**
   - Deck states "$300K from two leading VCs" but doesn't name them
   - Cannot verify quality of existing investors
   - **Impact:** Cannot reference check or assess strategic value of current cap table
   - **Action Required:** Request VC names for reference checks

5. **🟠 Eden's Track Record Unknown [MEDIUM SEVERITY]**
   - Deck mentions Perpie founder, tres.finance founding team
   - No details on outcomes of these ventures
   - **Impact:** Cannot assess founder's success rate or domain expertise depth
   - **Action Required:** Research Perpie and tres.finance outcomes, request details from Eden

#### SIGNIFICANT (Major Concerns - Monitor)

6. **🟠 Weak Competitive Moats [MEDIUM-HIGH SEVERITY]**
   - Easily replicable by larger platforms (Polymarket, BET)
   - No technical, regulatory, or network effect moats identified
   - First-mover advantage in micro-niche
   - **Risk:** Could be displaced within 6-12 months by competitor adding Twitter category
   - **Mitigation:** B2B partnerships (Polymarket/Kalshi) could create strategic defensibility

7. **🟠 Twitter Platform Dependency [MEDIUM-HIGH SEVERITY]**
   - Core product relies entirely on Twitter/X API
   - Already experienced API bugs (January 2025)
   - Subject to Twitter policy changes, pricing, or access revocation
   - **Risk:** Platform risk could render product inoperable overnight
   - **Mitigation:** Roadmap includes expansion to other social platforms

8. **🟠 Regulatory Uncertainty [MEDIUM SEVERITY]**
   - Prediction markets under increasing scrutiny (Polymarket, Kalshi precedents)
   - No disclosed compliance strategy or legal structure
   - **Risk:** Could face enforcement action, geographic restrictions, or shutdown
   - **Action Required:** Clarify legal structure and compliance approach

#### MODERATE (To Monitor)

9. **🟡 Solo Founder Risk [MEDIUM-LOW SEVERITY]**
   - Appears to be single founder (no co-founders mentioned in deck)
   - **Risk:** Key person dependency, execution capacity limits
   - **Mitigation:** Clear hiring plan (2 devs, designer, community lead) addresses capacity

10. **🟡 Very Early Stage [LOW-MEDIUM SEVERITY]**
    - Only 3 months since launch (September 2024)
    - **Risk:** Limited operating history
    - **Mitigation:** Strong early traction (200K bets, 6+ month streaks) reduces PMF risk

11. **🟡 No Media Coverage Yet [LOW SEVERITY]**
    - No major crypto media coverage (TechCrunch, CoinDesk)
    - **Signal:** Very early stage, pre-PR push
    - **Mitigation:** 10K DAU goal + brand strengthening in use of funds suggests awareness will grow
