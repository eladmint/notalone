SODA LABS (COTI V2) | Privacy Infrastructure for Web3 | Raising [Amount TBD] | Deck | Twitter

Bringing compliant, programmable privacy to every Web3 platform via garbled circuit-based MPC. COTI V2 mainnet went live March 2025 and is already generating revenue. Solving the biggest bottleneck to institutional Web3 adoption: privacy without sacrificing performance or security.

# TRACTION:

- COTI V2 mainnet live (March 2025) - already generating revenue
- 80 confidential transactions per second live in production
- Current throughput scales to 1k-10k ctps with naive parallelism
- POC with Chainlink Labs (institutional privacy bridge)
- 3 non-provisional patents submitted, more in pipeline
- Bubble plug-and-play solution live on major chains
- Partners: Nvidia, Chainlink, Hacken, ERC-3643, Coti, Bankz, Ownera, TeaFi
- [NOTE: "Shift Stocks" was incorrectly included here - this is a DIFFERENT PROJECT, not related to Soda Labs]

# WHY IT WINS

Position: Only GC-based MPC solution combining security, performance, AND battle-tested cryptography. Positioned at the convergence of three massive pain points: DeFi privacy, RWA tokenization compliance, and institutional crypto adoption.

Economics:
- Revenue-generating from day 1 via gcEVM licensing and support
- [NOTE: "$SHFT" and "Shift Stocks" references were DATA CONTAMINATION from a different project - NOT related to Soda Labs]
- Investment structure (token, equity, SAFE) NOT DISCLOSED in deck
- TAM: $15T+ annually across payments ($10.5T), DeFi ($8.5B daily), RWA tokenization ($5B daily)

Product:
- 1000-3000x faster than FHE-based solutions
- Only solution checking ALL boxes: Security + Performance + Private Shared State + Standard Hardware + Battle-tested Cryptography
- Runs on commodity cloud machines - no specialized hardware needed
- Developer-friendly: straightforward integration, no new syntax to learn
- Supports private AI/ML computations (fastest cryptographic solution available)

Team:
- Dr. Avishay Yanai, CEO: PhD Cryptography, 25+ academic papers on MPC, Senior VMware researcher, co-inventor of IKAS 2PC-MPC protocol
- Dr. Meital Levy, CTO: PhD Algorithmic Optimization from Tel-Aviv University, lead engineer of open-source SCAPI library, founding member at Qaratz Technologies
- Advisors: Prof. Yehuda Lindell (Head of Cryptography at Coinbase, prev. CEO of Unbound acquired by Coinbase), Prof. Mike Rosulek (Spearhead Cryptographer, Oregon State University)
- 50+ published papers and patents, now turning research into production

# FINANCIALS

Market Opportunity:
- Payments & Stablecoins: $10.5T transaction volume (last 12m) - B2B, A2A, subscriptions, payroll
- Trading & DeFi: $8.5B daily DEX volume - DEX, lending/borrowing, dark pools, collateral pools
- RWA Tokenization: $5B daily avg transfer volume (past 10 days) - tokenized securities, commodities, funds

GTM Strategy (Two Phases, 6-9 months each):
- Phase I - The Flywheel: Integration with top stablecoin infrastructure providers (exchanges, wallets, compliance, financial tooling) + building yield-bearing assets around shielded stablecoins
- Phase II - Scaling: Increase utility via lending, RWA investments, DeFi expansion (DEXes, prediction markets, DePIN, healthcare)

# THE DEAL

[Round Type]: $[Amount] raising now
- Entry: [Price per token/valuation TBD]
- Structure: [SAFE/Equity/Token warrants TBD]
- Unlock: [TBD]

Note: Deck does not specify fundraising amount or terms. This is a live, revenue-generating protocol with significant technical moats and world-class cryptography team.
