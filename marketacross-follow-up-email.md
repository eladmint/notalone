**Subject:** Following Up - NOTALONE Info & Israel Visit Nov 24-30

---

Hi,

Great talking on the call! As discussed, I wanted to send over more context about NOTALONE and our upcoming Israel visit before we meet face-to-face.

## About NOTALONE

NOTALONE is a global platform connecting capital, founders, and world-class operators to accelerate frontier technology across Web3, AI, and deep tech. We're building infrastructure for early-stage innovation that prioritizes alignment, transparency, and execution. We have $40M in soft commits (targeting $100M by Jan 2026) through our platform that facilitates fundraising collaboration, and we run a Ventures fund to support the best projects. Our investment focus includes RWA tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, BTCfi, AI infrastructure & compute, and GenAI stacks—areas where Israeli innovation is particularly strong.

Our model creates a flywheel: we source exceptional deals globally, invest through our fund, and open select opportunities to our LP network for co-investment. This generates deal flow visibility, builds trust through co-investment alignment, and creates a natural pipeline for our next fund. We also operate with 0% management fees and milestone-based capital deployment—aligning everyone's incentives around actual performance.

Beyond capital, **NOTALONE Services** provides full-stack operational support to portfolio companies—from GTM strategy and fundraising execution to global network access and ecosystem scaling across 20+ countries. This means our portfolio companies get more than just funding; they get hands-on war partners for growth.

## The Team Behind NOTALONE

What makes NOTALONE different is that our team are operators, not just financiers. We've spent years building startup ecosystems from the ground up:

**At NEAR Protocol**, we architected the NEAR Developer Program and University, growing the developer base from virtually zero to over 10,000 developers trained and 1,000+ certified, and helped launch 300+ projects in one year. We set up global hackathons, education pipelines, and accelerators—50% of whose graduates successfully launched on NEAR's network.

**At DFINITY (Internet Computer)**, we led worldwide community expansion, establishing local hubs in 33 countries and training 20k+ developers through 200+ hackathons, resulting in 350+ projects built on ICP. We introduced programs like the decentralized accelerator "Olympus" and multi-country hacker houses (Chain Fusion Hubs).

This track record across 30+ countries means we have firsthand relationships with hundreds of founders, engineers, and ecosystem partners globally—which directly benefits our deal flow, due diligence, and portfolio support.

**The core team includes:**

- **David Shengart** (Investment Lead): Ex-GP at Unicorn Factory Ventures, worked extensively with Israeli founders, Jewish Ukrainian background and Israeli citizen—which adds a personal dimension to our Israel visit
- **Clement Chaikov** (Network Architect): Led operations infrastructure and global events at DFINITY, built ICP's community network across 30+ countries, joining me for the Israel visit
- **Elad Miron** (myself): Led the ICP hub in Germany working with the team on ecosystem expansion, prior experience as Celo Foundation ambassador in Berlin

## Recent Validation & Traction

The market is validating our approach:

- **ECHO acquisition by Coinbase ($375M)** - During our US roadshow, a simpler version of our platform model was acquired, demonstrating the value proposition we're building at scale
- **Strong institutional partnerships** - SF-based Fund of Funds ($8B AUM) and NYC Family Offices ($10B+ AUM) actively participating in our deals
- **Global expansion momentum** - Active roadshows across Buenos Aires, Israel, India, Abu Dhabi, with Davos scheduled

Our fund performance backs this up: OpenXAI delivered 7x realized returns and 20x unrealized, we've closed a 50% discount OTC deal with 50% principal already recovered, and we have $50-80M in liquidity deals progressing across top-100 CMC projects. We have 2 TGEs scheduled in Q4 2025 and 4 more in Q1 2026.


## How You Can Help

As discussed, Clement Chaikov and I will be in Israel on Nov 24-29 and we will be happy to schedule a meeting at your office and learn more about MarketAcross. 

In the meantime, your assistance with organizing meetings during our visit would be incredibly valuable. We're looking to connect with:
- Companies focused on security infrastructure, privacy tech (FHE/ZK), RWA tokenization, and DeFi infrastructure
- High-potential emerging companies solving hard infrastructure problems
- Key ecosystem players, investors, and builders doing interesting things in Web3/AI, demonstrating the strength and potential of the Startup Nation.

Any warm introductions you can facilitate would be greatly appreciated!

Let me know what dates/times work best for meeting at your office during Nov 24-29.

Looking forward to connecting in person!

Best regards,
Elad
